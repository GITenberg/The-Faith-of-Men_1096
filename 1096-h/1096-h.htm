<h2>A RELIC OF THE PLIOCENE</h2>
<p>I wash my hands of him at the start.&nbsp; I cannot father his tales,
nor will I be responsible for them.&nbsp; I make these preliminary reservations,
observe, as a guard upon my own integrity.&nbsp; I possess a certain
definite position in a small way, also a wife; and for the good name
of the community that honours my existence with its approval, and for
the sake of her posterity and mine, I cannot take the chances I once
did, nor foster probabilities with the careless improvidence of youth.&nbsp;
So, I repeat, I wash my hands of him, this Nimrod, this mighty hunter,
this homely, blue-eyed, freckle-faced Thomas Stevens.</p>
<p>Having been honest to myself, and to whatever prospective olive branches
my wife may be pleased to tender me, I can now afford to be generous.&nbsp;
I shall not criticize the tales told me by Thomas Stevens, and, further,
I shall withhold my judgment.&nbsp; If it be asked why, I can only add
that judgment I have none.&nbsp; Long have I pondered, weighed, and
balanced, but never have my conclusions been twice the same&mdash;forsooth!
because Thomas Stevens is a greater man than I.&nbsp; If he have told
truths, well and good; if untruths, still well and good.&nbsp; For who
can prove? or who disprove?&nbsp; I eliminate myself from the proposition,
while those of little faith may do as I have done&mdash;go find the
same Thomas Stevens, and discuss to his face the various matters which,
if fortune serve, I shall relate.&nbsp; As to where he may be found?&nbsp;
The directions are simple: anywhere between 53 north latitude and the
Pole, on the one hand; and, on the other, the likeliest hunting grounds
that lie between the east coast of Siberia and farthermost Labrador.&nbsp;
That he is there, somewhere, within that clearly defined territory,
I pledge the word of an honourable man whose expectations entail straight
speaking and right living.</p>
<p>Thomas Stevens may have toyed prodigiously with truth, but when we
first met (it were well to mark this point), he wandered into my camp
when I thought myself a thousand miles beyond the outermost post of
civilization.&nbsp; At the sight of his human face, the first in weary
months, I could have sprung forward and folded him in my arms (and I
am not by any means a demonstrative man); but to him his visit seemed
the most casual thing under the sun.&nbsp; He just strolled into the
light of my camp, passed the time of day after the custom of men on
beaten trails, threw my snowshoes the one way and a couple of dogs the
other, and so made room for himself by the fire.&nbsp; Said he&rsquo;d
just dropped in to borrow a pinch of soda and to see if I had any decent
tobacco.&nbsp; He plucked forth an ancient pipe, loaded it with painstaking
care, and, without as much as by your leave, whacked half the tobacco
of my pouch into his.&nbsp; Yes, the stuff was fairly good.&nbsp; He
sighed with the contentment of the just, and literally absorbed the
smoke from the crisping yellow flakes, and it did my smoker&rsquo;s
heart good to behold him.</p>
<p>Hunter?&nbsp; Trapper?&nbsp; Prospector?&nbsp; He shrugged his shoulders
No; just sort of knocking round a bit.&nbsp; Had come up from the Great
Slave some time since, and was thinking of trapsing over into the Yukon
country.&nbsp; The factor of Koshim had spoken about the discoveries
on the Klondike, and he was of a mind to run over for a peep.&nbsp;
I noticed that he spoke of the Klondike in the archaic vernacular, calling
it the Reindeer River&mdash;a conceited custom that the Old Timers employ
against the <i>che</i>-<i>chaquas</i> and all tenderfeet in general.&nbsp;
But he did it so naively and as such a matter of course, that there
was no sting, and I forgave him.&nbsp; He also had it in view, he said,
before he crossed the divide into the Yukon, to make a little run up
Fort o&rsquo; Good Hope way.</p>
<p>Now Fort o&rsquo; Good Hope is a far journey to the north, over and
beyond the Circle, in a place where the feet of few men have trod; and
when a nondescript ragamuffin comes in out of the night, from nowhere
in particular, to sit by one&rsquo;s fire and discourse on such in terms
of &ldquo;trapsing&rdquo; and &ldquo;a little run,&rdquo; it is fair
time to rouse up and shake off the dream.&nbsp; Wherefore I looked about
me; saw the fly and, underneath, the pine boughs spread for the sleeping
furs; saw the grub sacks, the camera, the frosty breaths of the dogs
circling on the edge of the light; and, above, a great streamer of the
aurora, bridging the zenith from south-east to north-west.&nbsp; I shivered.&nbsp;
There is a magic in the Northland night, that steals in on one like
fevers from malarial marshes.&nbsp; You are clutched and downed before
you are aware.&nbsp; Then I looked to the snowshoes, lying prone and
crossed where he had flung them.&nbsp; Also I had an eye to my tobacco
pouch.&nbsp; Half, at least, of its goodly store had vamosed.&nbsp;
That settled it.&nbsp; Fancy had not tricked me after all.</p>
<p>Crazed with suffering, I thought, looking steadfastly at the man&mdash;one
of those wild stampeders, strayed far from his bearings and wandering
like a lost soul through great vastnesses and unknown deeps.&nbsp; Oh,
well, let his moods slip on, until, mayhap, he gathers his tangled wits
together.&nbsp; Who knows?&mdash;the mere sound of a fellow-creature&rsquo;s
voice may bring all straight again.</p>
<p>So I led him on in talk, and soon I marvelled, for he talked of game
and the ways thereof.&nbsp; He had killed the Siberian wolf of westernmost
Alaska, and the chamois in the secret Rockies.&nbsp; He averred he knew
the haunts where the last buffalo still roamed; that he had hung on
the flanks of the caribou when they ran by the hundred thousand, and
slept in the Great Barrens on the musk-ox&rsquo;s winter trail.</p>
<p>And I shifted my judgment accordingly (the first revision, but by
no account the last), and deemed him a monumental effigy of truth.&nbsp;
Why it was I know not, but the spirit moved me to repeat a tale told
to me by a man who had dwelt in the land too long to know better.&nbsp;
It was of the great bear that hugs the steep slopes of St Elias, never
descending to the levels of the gentler inclines.&nbsp; Now God so constituted
this creature for its hillside habitat that the legs of one side are
all of a foot longer than those of the other.&nbsp; This is mighty convenient,
as will be reality admitted.&nbsp; So I hunted this rare beast in my
own name, told it in the first person, present tense, painted the requisite
locale, gave it the necessary garnishings and touches of verisimilitude,
and looked to see the man stunned by the recital.</p>
<p>Not he.&nbsp; Had he doubted, I could have forgiven him.&nbsp; Had
he objected, denying the dangers of such a hunt by virtue of the animal&rsquo;s
inability to turn about and go the other way&mdash;had he done this,
I say, I could have taken him by the hand for the true sportsman that
he was.&nbsp; Not he.&nbsp; He sniffed, looked on me, and sniffed again;
then gave my tobacco due praise, thrust one foot into my lap, and bade
me examine the gear.&nbsp; It was a <i>mucluc</i> of the Innuit pattern,
sewed together with sinew threads, and devoid of beads or furbelows.&nbsp;
But it was the skin itself that was remarkable.&nbsp; In that it was
all of half an inch thick, it reminded me of walrus-hide; but there
the resemblance ceased, for no walrus ever bore so marvellous a growth
of hair.&nbsp; On the side and ankles this hair was well-nigh worn away,
what of friction with underbrush and snow; but around the top and down
the more sheltered back it was coarse, dirty black, and very thick.&nbsp;
I parted it with difficulty and looked beneath for the fine fur that
is common with northern animals, but found it in this case to be absent.&nbsp;
This, however, was compensated for by the length.&nbsp; Indeed, the
tufts that had survived wear and tear measured all of seven or eight
inches.</p>
<p>I looked up into the man&rsquo;s face, and he pulled his foot down
and asked, &ldquo;Find hide like that on your St Elias bear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shook my head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nor on any other creature of land or
sea,&rdquo; I answered candidly.&nbsp; The thickness of it, and the
length of the hair, puzzled me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said, and said without the slightest hint
of impressiveness, &ldquo;that came from a mammoth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; I exclaimed, for I could not forbear the
protest of my unbelief.&nbsp; &ldquo;The mammoth, my dear sir, long
ago vanished from the earth.&nbsp; We know it once existed by the fossil
remains that we have unearthed, and by a frozen carcase that the Siberian
sun saw fit to melt from out the bosom of a glacier; but we also know
that no living specimen exists.&nbsp; Our explorers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this word he broke in impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your explorers?&nbsp;
Pish!&nbsp; A weakly breed.&nbsp; Let us hear no more of them.&nbsp;
But tell me, O man, what you may know of the mammoth and his ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beyond contradiction, this was leading to a yarn; so I baited my
hook by ransacking my memory for whatever data I possessed on the subject
in hand.&nbsp; To begin with, I emphasized that the animal was prehistoric,
and marshalled all my facts in support of this.&nbsp; I mentioned the
Siberian sand-bars that abounded with ancient mammoth bones; spoke of
the large quantities of fossil ivory purchased from the Innuits by the
Alaska Commercial Company; and acknowledged having myself mined six-
and eight-foot tusks from the pay gravel of the Klondike creeks.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All fossils,&rdquo; I concluded, &ldquo;found in the midst of
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> deposited through countless ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember when I was a kid,&rdquo; Thomas Stevens sniffed
(he had a most confounded way of sniffing), &ldquo;that I saw a petrified
water-melon.&nbsp; Hence, though mistaken persons sometimes delude themselves
into thinking that they are really raising or eating them, there are
no such things as extant water-melons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the question of food,&rdquo; I objected, ignoring his
point, which was puerile and without bearing.&nbsp; &ldquo;The soil
must bring forth vegetable life in lavish abundance to support so monstrous
creations.&nbsp; Nowhere in the North is the soil so prolific.&nbsp;
Ergo, the mammoth cannot exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pardon your ignorance concerning many matters of this Northland,
for you are a young man and have travelled little; but, at the same
time, I am inclined to agree with you on one thing.&nbsp; The mammoth
no longer exists.&nbsp; How do I know?&nbsp; I killed the last one with
my own right arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus spake Nimrod, the mighty Hunter.&nbsp; I threw a stick of firewood
at the dogs and bade them quit their unholy howling, and waited.&nbsp;
Undoubtedly this liar of singular felicity would open his mouth and
requite me for my St. Elias bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was this way,&rdquo; he at last began, after the appropriate
silence had intervened.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was in camp one day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; I interrupted.</p>
<p>He waved his hand vaguely in the direction of the north-east, where
stretched a <i>terra</i> <i>incognita</i> into which vastness few men
have strayed and fewer emerged.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was in camp one day with
Klooch.&nbsp; Klooch was as handsome a little <i>kamooks</i> as ever
whined betwixt the traces or shoved nose into a camp kettle.&nbsp; Her
father was a full-blood Malemute from Russian Pastilik on Bering Sea,
and I bred her, and with understanding, out of a clean-legged bitch
of the Hudson Bay stock.&nbsp; I tell you, O man, she was a corker combination.&nbsp;
And now, on this day I have in mind, she was brought to pup through
a pure wild wolf of the woods&mdash;grey, and long of limb, with big
lungs and no end of staying powers.&nbsp; Say!&nbsp; Was there ever
the like?&nbsp; It was a new breed of dog I had started, and I could
look forward to big things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I have said, she was brought neatly to pup, and safely
delivered.&nbsp; I was squatting on my hams over the litter&mdash;seven
sturdy, blind little beggars&mdash;when from behind came a bray of trumpets
and crash of brass.&nbsp; There was a rush, like the wind-squall that
kicks the heels of the rain, and I was midway to my feet when knocked
flat on my face.&nbsp; At the same instant I heard Klooch sigh, very
much as a man does when you&rsquo;ve planted your fist in his belly.&nbsp;
You can stake your sack I lay quiet, but I twisted my head around and
saw a huge bulk swaying above me.&nbsp; Then the blue sky flashed into
view and I got to my feet.&nbsp; A hairy mountain of flesh was just
disappearing in the underbrush on the edge of the open.&nbsp; I caught
a rear-end glimpse, with a stiff tail, as big in girth as my body, standing
out straight behind.&nbsp; The next second only a tremendous hole remained
in the thicket, though I could still hear the sounds as of a tornado
dying quickly away, underbrush ripping and tearing, and trees snapping
and crashing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cast about for my rifle.&nbsp; It had been lying on the
ground with the muzzle against a log; but now the stock was smashed,
the barrel out of line, and the working-gear in a thousand bits.&nbsp;
Then I looked for the slut, and&mdash;and what do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May my soul burn in a thousand hells if there was anything
left of her!&nbsp; Klooch, the seven sturdy, blind little beggars&mdash;gone,
all gone.&nbsp; Where she had stretched was a slimy, bloody depression
in the soft earth, all of a yard in diameter, and around the edges a
few scattered hairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I measured three feet on the snow, threw about it a circle, and glanced
at Nimrod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beast was thirty long and twenty high,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;and its tusks scaled over six times three feet.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t
believe, myself, at the time, for all that it had just happened.&nbsp;
But if my senses had played me, there was the broken gun and the hole
in the brush.&nbsp; And there was&mdash;or, rather, there was not&mdash;Klooch
and the pups.&nbsp; O man, it makes me hot all over now when I think
of it Klooch!&nbsp; Another Eve!&nbsp; The mother of a new race!&nbsp;
And a rampaging, ranting, old bull mammoth, like a second flood, wiping
them, root and branch, off the face of the earth!&nbsp; Do you wonder
that the blood-soaked earth cried out to high God?&nbsp; Or that I grabbed
the hand-axe and took the trail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hand-axe?&rdquo; I exclaimed, startled out of myself by
the picture.&nbsp; &ldquo;The hand-axe, and a big bull mammoth, thirty
feet long, twenty feet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nimrod joined me in my merriment, chuckling gleefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t
it kill you?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it a beaver&rsquo;s
dream?&nbsp; Many&rsquo;s the time I&rsquo;ve laughed about it since,
but at the time it was no laughing matter, I was that danged mad, what
of the gun and Klooch.&nbsp; Think of it, O man!&nbsp; A brand-new,
unclassified, uncopyrighted breed, and wiped out before ever it opened
its eyes or took out its intention papers!&nbsp; Well, so be it.&nbsp;
Life&rsquo;s full of disappointments, and rightly so.&nbsp; Meat is
best after a famine, and a bed soft after a hard trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was saying, I took out after the beast with the hand-axe,
and hung to its heels down the valley; but when he circled back toward
the head, I was left winded at the lower end.&nbsp; Speaking of grub,
I might as well stop long enough to explain a couple of points.&nbsp;
Up thereabouts, in the midst of the mountains, is an almighty curious
formation.&nbsp; There is no end of little valleys, each like the other
much as peas in a pod, and all neatly tucked away with straight, rocky
walls rising on all sides.&nbsp; And at the lower ends are always small
openings where the drainage or glaciers must have broken out.&nbsp;
The only way in is through these mouths, and they are all small, and
some smaller than others.&nbsp; As to grub&mdash;you&rsquo;ve slushed
around on the rain-soaked islands of the Alaskan coast down Sitka way,
most likely, seeing as you&rsquo;re a traveller.&nbsp; And you know
how stuff grows there&mdash;big, and juicy, and jungly.&nbsp; Well,
that&rsquo;s the way it was with those valleys.&nbsp; Thick, rich soil,
with ferns and grasses and such things in patches higher than your head.&nbsp;
Rain three days out of four during the summer months; and food in them
for a thousand mammoths, to say nothing of small game for man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to get back.&nbsp; Down at the lower end of the valley
I got winded and gave over.&nbsp; I began to speculate, for when my
wind left me my dander got hotter and hotter, and I knew I&rsquo;d never
know peace of mind till I dined on roasted mammoth-foot.&nbsp; And I
knew, also, that that stood for <i>skookum</i> <i>mamook</i> <i>pukapuk</i>&mdash;excuse
Chinook, I mean there was a big fight coming.&nbsp; Now the mouth of
my valley was very narrow, and the walls steep.&nbsp; High up on one
side was one of those big pivot rocks, or balancing rocks, as some call
them, weighing all of a couple of hundred tons.&nbsp; Just the thing.&nbsp;
I hit back for camp, keeping an eye open so the bull couldn&rsquo;t
slip past, and got my ammunition.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t worth anything
with the rifle smashed; so I opened the shells, planted the powder under
the rock, and touched it off with slow fuse.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t much
of a charge, but the old boulder tilted up lazily and dropped down into
place, with just space enough to let the creek drain nicely.&nbsp; Now
I had him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you have him?&rdquo; I queried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who
ever heard of a man killing a mammoth with a hand-axe?&nbsp; And, for
that matter, with anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O man, have I not told you I was mad?&rdquo; Nimrod replied,
with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mad clean
through, what of Klooch and the gun.&nbsp; Also, was I not a hunter?&nbsp;
And was this not new and most unusual game?&nbsp; A hand-axe?&nbsp;
Pish!&nbsp; I did not need it.&nbsp; Listen, and you shall hear of a
hunt, such as might have happened in the youth of the world when cavemen
rounded up the kill with hand-axe of stone.&nbsp; Such would have served
me as well.&nbsp; Now is it not a fact that man can outwalk the dog
or horse?&nbsp; That he can wear them out with the intelligence of his
endurance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The light broke in on me, and I bade him continue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My valley was perhaps five miles around.&nbsp; The mouth was
closed.&nbsp; There was no way to get out.&nbsp; A timid beast was that
bull mammoth, and I had him at my mercy.&nbsp; I got on his heels again
hollered like a fiend, pelted him with cobbles, and raced him around
the valley three times before I knocked off for supper.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you see?&nbsp; A race-course!&nbsp; A man and a mammoth!&nbsp; A hippodrome,
with sun, moon, and stars to referee!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It took me two months to do it, but I did it.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s
no beaver dream.&nbsp; Round and round I ran him, me travelling on the
inner circle, eating jerked meat and salmon berries on the run, and
snatching winks of sleep between.&nbsp; Of course, he&rsquo;d get desperate
at times and turn.&nbsp; Then I&rsquo;d head for soft ground where the
creek spread out, and lay anathema upon him and his ancestry, and dare
him to come on.&nbsp; But he was too wise to bog in a mud puddle.&nbsp;
Once he pinned me in against the walls, and I crawled back into a deep
crevice and waited.&nbsp; Whenever he felt for me with his trunk, I&rsquo;d
belt him with the hand-axe till he pulled out, shrieking fit to split
my ear drums, he was that mad.&nbsp; He knew he had me and didn&rsquo;t
have me, and it near drove him wild.&nbsp; But he was no man&rsquo;s
fool.&nbsp; He knew he was safe as long as I stayed in the crevice,
and he made up his mind to keep me there.&nbsp; And he was dead right,
only he hadn&rsquo;t figured on the commissary.&nbsp; There was neither
grub nor water around that spot, so on the face of it he couldn&rsquo;t
keep up the siege.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d stand before the opening for hours,
keeping an eye on me and flapping mosquitoes away with his big blanket
ears.&nbsp; Then the thirst would come on him and he&rsquo;d ramp round
and roar till the earth shook, calling me every name he could lay tongue
to.&nbsp; This was to frighten me, of course; and when he thought I
was sufficiently impressed, he&rsquo;d back away softly and try to make
a sneak for the creek.&nbsp; Sometimes I&rsquo;d let him get almost
there&mdash;only a couple of hundred yards away it was&mdash;when out
I&rsquo;d pop and back he&rsquo;d come, lumbering along like the old
landslide he was.&nbsp; After I&rsquo;d done this a few times, and he&rsquo;d
figured it out, he changed his tactics.&nbsp; Grasped the time element,
you see.&nbsp; Without a word of warning, away he&rsquo;d go, tearing
for the water like mad, scheming to get there and back before I ran
away.&nbsp; Finally, after cursing me most horribly, he raised the siege
and deliberately stalked off to the water-hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the only time he penned me,&mdash;three days of it,&mdash;but
after that the hippodrome never stopped.&nbsp; Round, and round, and
round, like a six days&rsquo; go-as-I-please, for he never pleased.&nbsp;
My clothes went to rags and tatters, but I never stopped to mend, till
at last I ran naked as a son of earth, with nothing but the old hand-axe
in one hand and a cobble in the other.&nbsp; In fact, I never stopped,
save for peeps of sleep in the crannies and ledges of the cliffs.&nbsp;
As for the bull, he got perceptibly thinner and thinner&mdash;must have
lost several tons at least&mdash;and as nervous as a schoolmarm on the
wrong side of matrimony.&nbsp; When I&rsquo;d come up with him and yell,
or lain him with a rock at long range, he&rsquo;d jump like a skittish
colt and tremble all over.&nbsp; Then he&rsquo;d pull out on the run,
tail and trunk waving stiff, head over one shoulder and wicked eyes
blazing, and the way he&rsquo;d swear at me was something dreadful.&nbsp;
A most immoral beast he was, a murderer, and a blasphemer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But towards the end he quit all this, and fell to whimpering
and crying like a baby.&nbsp; His spirit broke and he became a quivering
jelly-mountain of misery.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d get attacks of palpitation
of the heart, and stagger around like a drunken man, and fall down and
bark his shins.&nbsp; And then he&rsquo;d cry, but always on the run.&nbsp;
O man, the gods themselves would have wept with him, and you yourself
or any other man.&nbsp; It was pitiful, and there was so I much of it,
but I only hardened my heart and hit up the pace.&nbsp; At last I wore
him clean out, and he lay down, broken-winded, broken-hearted, hungry,
and thirsty.&nbsp; When I found he wouldn&rsquo;t budge, I hamstrung
him, and spent the better part of the day wading into him with the hand-axe,
he a-sniffing and sobbing till I worked in far enough to shut him off.&nbsp;
Thirty feet long he was, and twenty high, and a man could sling a hammock
between his tusks and sleep comfortably.&nbsp; Barring the fact that
I had run most of the juices out of him, he was fair eating, and his
four feet, alone, roasted whole, would have lasted a man a twelvemonth.&nbsp;
I spent the winter there myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is this valley?&rdquo; I asked</p>
<p>He waved his hand in the direction of the north-east, and said: &ldquo;Your
tobacco is very good.&nbsp; I carry a fair share of it in my pouch,
but I shall carry the recollection of it until I die.&nbsp; In token
of my appreciation, and in return for the moccasins on your own feet,
I will present to you these <i>muclucs</i>.&nbsp; They commemorate Klooch
and the seven blind little beggars.&nbsp; They are also souvenirs of
an unparalleled event in history, namely, the destruction of the oldest
breed of animal on earth, and the youngest.&nbsp; And their chief virtue
lies in that they will never wear out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having effected the exchange, he knocked the ashes from his pipe,
gripped my hand good-night, and wandered off through the snow.&nbsp;
Concerning this tale, for which I have already disclaimed responsibility,
I would recommend those of little faith to make a visit to the Smithsonian
Institute.&nbsp; If they bring the requisite credentials and do not
come in vacation time, they will undoubtedly gain an audience with Professor
Dolvidson.&nbsp; The <i>muclucs</i> are in his possession, and he will
verify, not the manner in which they were obtained, but the material
of which they are composed.&nbsp; When he states that they are made
from the skin of the mammoth, the scientific world accepts his verdict.&nbsp;
What more would you have?</p>
<h2>A HYPERBOREAN BREW</h2>
<p>[The story of a scheming white man among the strange people who live
on the rim of the Arctic sea]</p>
<p>Thomas Stevens&rsquo;s veracity may have been indeterminate as <i>x</i>,
and his imagination the imagination of ordinary men increased to the
nth power, but this, at least, must be said: never did he deliver himself
of word nor deed that could be branded as a lie outright. . . He may
have played with probability, and verged on the extremest edge of possibility,
but in his tales the machinery never creaked.&nbsp; That he knew the
Northland like a book, not a soul can deny.&nbsp; That he was a great
traveller, and had set foot on countless unknown trails, many evidences
affirm.&nbsp; Outside of my own personal knowledge, I knew men that
had met him everywhere, but principally on the confines of Nowhere.&nbsp;
There was Johnson, the ex-Hudson Bay Company factor, who had housed
him in a Labrador factory until his dogs rested up a bit, and he was
able to strike out again.&nbsp; There was McMahon, agent for the Alaska
Commercial Company, who had run across him in Dutch Harbour, and later
on, among the outlying islands of the Aleutian group.&nbsp; It was indisputable
that he had guided one of the earlier United States surveys, and history
states positively that in a similar capacity he served the Western Union
when it attempted to put through its trans-Alaskan and Siberian telegraph
to Europe.&nbsp; Further, there was Joe Lamson, the whaling captain,
who, when ice-bound off the mouth of the Mackenzie, had had him come
aboard after tobacco.&nbsp; This last touch proves Thomas Stevens&rsquo;s
identity conclusively.&nbsp; His quest for tobacco was perennial and
untiring.&nbsp; Ere we became fairly acquainted, I learned to greet
him with one hand, and pass the pouch with the other.&nbsp; But the
night I met him in John O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s Dawson saloon, his head
was wreathed in a nimbus of fifty-cent cigar smoke, and instead of my
pouch he demanded my sack.&nbsp; We were standing by a faro table, and
forthwith he tossed it upon the &ldquo;high card.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Fifty,&rdquo;
he said, and the game-keeper nodded.&nbsp; The &ldquo;high card&rdquo;
turned, and he handed back my sack, called for a &ldquo;tab,&rdquo;
and drew me over to the scales, where the weigher nonchalantly cashed
him out fifty dollars in dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now we&rsquo;ll drink,&rdquo; he said; and later, at the
bar, when he lowered his glass: &ldquo;Reminds me of a little brew I
had up Tattarat way.&nbsp; No, you have no knowledge of the place, nor
is it down on the charts.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s up by the rim of the
Arctic Sea, not so many hundred miles from the American line, and all
of half a thousand God-forsaken souls live there, giving and taking
in marriage, and starving and dying in-between-whiles.&nbsp; Explorers
have overlooked them, and you will not find them in the census of 1890.&nbsp;
A whale-ship was pinched there once, but the men, who had made shore
over the ice, pulled out for the south and were never heard of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was a great brew we had, Moosu and I,&rdquo; he added
a moment later, with just the slightest suspicion of a sigh.</p>
<p>I knew there were big deeds and wild doings behind that sigh, so
I haled him into a corner, between a roulette outfit and a poker layout,
and waited for his tongue to thaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had one objection to Moosu,&rdquo; he began, cocking his head
meditatively&mdash;&ldquo;one objection, and only one.&nbsp; He was
an Indian from over on the edge of the Chippewyan country, but the trouble
was, he&rsquo;d picked up a smattering of the Scriptures.&nbsp; Been
campmate a season with a renegade French Canadian who&rsquo;d studied
for the church.&nbsp; Moosu&rsquo;d never seen applied Christianity,
and his head was crammed with miracles, battles, and dispensations,
and what not he didn&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; Otherwise he was a good
sort, and a handy man on trail or over a fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d had a hard time together and were badly knocked
out when we plumped upon Tattarat.&nbsp; Lost outfits and dogs crossing
a divide in a fall blizzard, and our bellies clove to our backs and
our clothes were in rags when we crawled into the village.&nbsp; They
weren&rsquo;t much surprised at seeing us&mdash;because of the whalemen&mdash;and
gave us the meanest shack in the village to live in, and the worst of
their leavings to live on.&nbsp; What struck me at the time as strange
was that they left us strictly alone.&nbsp; But Moosu explained it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shaman <i>sick</i> <i>tumtum</i>,&rsquo; he said, meaning
the shaman, or medicine man, was jealous, and had advised the people
to have nothing to do with us.&nbsp; From the little he&rsquo;d seen
of the whalemen, he&rsquo;d learned that mine was a stronger race, and
a wiser; so he&rsquo;d only behaved as shamans have always behaved the
world over.&nbsp; And before I get done, you&rsquo;ll see how near right
he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;These people have a law,&rsquo; said Mosu: &lsquo;whoso
eats of meat must hunt.&nbsp; We be awkward, you and I, O master, in
the weapons of this country; nor can we string bows nor fling spears
after the manner approved.&nbsp; Wherefore the shaman and Tummasook,
who is chief, have put their heads together, and it has been decreed
that we work with the women and children in dragging in the meat and
tending the wants of the hunters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And this is very wrong,&rsquo; I made to answer; &lsquo;for
we be better men, Moosu, than these people who walk in darkness.&nbsp;
Further, we should rest and grow strong, for the way south is long,
and on that trail the weak cannot prosper.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But we have nothing,&rsquo; he objected, looking about
him at the rotten timbers of the igloo, the stench of the ancient walrus
meat that had been our supper disgusting his nostrils.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
on this fare we cannot thrive.&nbsp; We have nothing save the bottle
of &ldquo;pain-killer,&rdquo; which will not fill emptiness, so we must
bend to the yoke of the unbeliever and become hewers of wood and drawers
of water.&nbsp; And there be good things in this place, the which we
may not have.&nbsp; Ah, master, never has my nose lied to me, and I
have followed it to secret caches and among the fur-bales of the igloos.&nbsp;
Good provender did these people extort from the poor whalemen, and this
provender has wandered into few hands.&nbsp; The woman Ipsukuk, who
dwelleth in the far end of the village next she igloo of the chief,
possesseth much flour and sugar, and even have my eyes told me of molasses
smeared on her face.&nbsp; And in the igloo of Tummasook, the chief,
there be tea&mdash;have I not seen the old pig guzzling?&nbsp; And the
shaman owneth a caddy of &ldquo;Star&rdquo; and two buckets of prime
smoking.&nbsp; And what have we?&nbsp; Nothing!&nbsp; Nothing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was stunned by the word he brought of the tobacco, and
made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Moosu, what of his own desire, broke silence: &lsquo;And
there be Tukeliketa, daughter of a big hunter and wealthy man.&nbsp;
A likely girl.&nbsp; Indeed, a very nice girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I figured hard during the night while Moosu snored, for I
could not bear the thought of the tobacco so near which I could not
smoke.&nbsp; True, as he had said, we had nothing.&nbsp; But the way
became clear to me, and in the morning I said to him: &lsquo;Go thou
cunningly abroad, after thy fashion, and procure me some sort of bone,
crooked like a gooseneck, and hollow.&nbsp; Also, walk humbly, but have
eyes awake to the lay of pots and pans and cooking contrivances.&nbsp;
And remember, mine is the white man&rsquo;s wisdom, and do what I have
bid you, with sureness and despatch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While he was away I placed the whale-oil cooking lamp in the
middle of the igloo, and moved the mangy sleeping furs back that I might
have room.&nbsp; Then I took apart his gun and put the barrel by handy,
and afterwards braided many wicks from the cotton that the women gather
wild in the summer.&nbsp; When he came back, it was with the bone I
had commanded, and with news that in the igloo of Tummasook there was
a five-gallon kerosene can and a big copper kettle.&nbsp; So I said
he had done well and we would tarry through the day.&nbsp; And when
midnight was near I made harangue to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This chief, this Tummasook, hath a copper kettle, likewise
a kerosene can.&rsquo;&nbsp; I put a rock, smooth and wave-washed, in
Moosu&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;The camp is hushed and the stars are
winking.&nbsp; Go thou, creep into the chief&rsquo;s igloo softly, and
smite him thus upon the belly, and hard.&nbsp; And let the meat and
good grub of the days to come put strength into thine arm.&nbsp; There
will be uproar and outcry, and the village will come hot afoot.&nbsp;
But be thou unafraid.&nbsp; Veil thy movements and lose thy form in
the obscurity of the night and the confusion of men.&nbsp; And when
the woman Ipsukuk is anigh thee,&mdash;she who smeareth her face with
molasses,&mdash;do thou smite her likewise, and whosoever else that
possesseth flour and cometh to thy hand.&nbsp; Then do thou lift thy
voice in pain and double up with clasped hands, and make outcry in token
that thou, too, hast felt the visitation of the night.&nbsp; And in
this way shall we achieve honour and great possessions, and the caddy
of &ldquo;Star&rdquo; and the prime smoking, and thy Tukeliketa, who
is a likely maiden.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he had departed on this errand, I bided patiently in
the shack, and the tobacco seemed very near.&nbsp; Then there was a
cry of affright in the night, that became an uproar and assailed the
sky.&nbsp; I seized the &lsquo;pain-killer&rsquo; and ran forth.&nbsp;
There was much noise, and a wailing among the women, and fear sat heavily
on all.&nbsp; Tummasook and the woman Ipsukuk rolled on the ground in
pain, and with them there were divers others, also Moosu.&nbsp; I thrust
aside those that cluttered the way of my feet, and put the mouth of
the bottle to Moosu&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp; And straightway he became well
and ceased his howling.&nbsp; Whereat there was a great clamour for
the bottle from the others so stricken.&nbsp; But I made harangue, and
ere they tasted and were made well I had mulcted Tummasook of his copper
kettle and kerosene can, and the woman Ipsukuk of her sugar and molasses,
and the other sick ones of goodly measures of flour.&nbsp; The shaman
glowered wickedly at the people around my knees, though he poorly concealed
the wonder that lay beneath.&nbsp; But I held my head high, and Moosu
groaned beneath the loot as he followed my heels to the shack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There I set to work.&nbsp; In Tummasook&rsquo;s copper kettle
I mixed three quarts of wheat flour with five of molasses, and to this
I added of water twenty quarts.&nbsp; Then I placed the kettle near
the lamp, that it might sour in the warmth and grow strong.&nbsp; Moosu
understood, and said my wisdom passed understanding and was greater
than Solomon&rsquo;s, who he had heard was a wise man of old time.&nbsp;
The kerosene can I set over the lamp, and to its nose I affixed a snout,
and into the snout the bone that was like a gooseneck.&nbsp; I sent
Moosu without to pound ice, while I connected the barrel of his gun
with the gooseneck, and midway on the barrel I piled the ice he had
pounded.&nbsp; And at the far end of the gun-barrel, beyond the pan
of ice, I placed a small iron pot.&nbsp; When the brew was strong enough
(and it was two days ere it could stand on its own legs), I filled the
kerosene can with it, and lighted the wicks I had braided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that all was ready, I spoke to Moosu.&nbsp; &lsquo;Go
forth,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;to the chief men of the village, and give
them greeting, and bid them come into my igloo and sleep the night away
with me and the gods.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brew was singing merrily when they began shoving aside
the skin flap and crawling in, and I was heaping cracked ice on the
gun-barrel.&nbsp; Out of the priming hole at the far end, drip, drip,
drip into the iron pot fell the liquor&mdash;<i>hooch</i>, you know.&nbsp;
But they&rsquo;d never seen the like, and giggled nervously when I made
harangue about its virtues.&nbsp; As I talked I noted the jealousy in
the shaman&rsquo;s eye, so when I had done, I placed him side by side
with Tummasook and the woman Ipsukuk.&nbsp; Then I gave them to drink,
and their eyes watered and their stomachs warmed, till from being afraid
they reached greedily for more; and when I had them well started, I
turned to the others.&nbsp; Tummasook made a brag about how he had once
killed a polar bear, and in the vigour of his pantomime nearly slew
his mother&rsquo;s brother.&nbsp; But nobody heeded.&nbsp; The woman
Ipsukuk fell to weeping for a son lost long years agone in the ice,
and the shaman made incantation and prophecy.&nbsp; So it went, and
before morning they were all on the floor, sleeping soundly with the
gods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story tells itself, does it not?&nbsp; The news of the
magic potion spread.&nbsp; It was too marvellous for utterance.&nbsp;
Tongues could tell but a tithe of the miracles it performed.&nbsp; It
eased pain, gave surcease to sorrow, brought back old memories, dead
faces, and forgotten dreams.&nbsp; It was a fire that ate through all
the blood, and, burning, burned not.&nbsp; It stoutened the heart, stiffened
the back, and made men more than men.&nbsp; It revealed the future,
and gave visions and prophecy.&nbsp; It brimmed with wisdom and unfolded
secrets.&nbsp; There was no end of the things it could do, and soon
there was a clamouring on all hands to sleep with the gods.&nbsp; They
brought their warmest furs, their strongest dogs, their best meats;
but I sold the <i>hooch</i> with discretion, and only those were favoured
that brought flour and molasses and sugar.&nbsp; And such stores poured
in that I set Moosu to build a cache to hold them, for there was soon
no space in the igloo.&nbsp; Ere three days had passed Tummasook had
gone bankrupt.&nbsp; The shaman, who was never more than half drunk
after the first night, watched me closely and hung on for the better
part of the week.&nbsp; But before ten days were gone, even the woman
Ipsukuk exhausted her provisions, and went home weak and tottery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Moosu complained.&nbsp; &lsquo;O master,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;we have laid by great wealth in molasses and sugar and flour,
but our shack is yet mean, our clothes thin, and our sleeping furs mangy.&nbsp;
There is a call of the belly for meat the stench of which offends not
the stars, and for tea such as Tummasook guzzles, and there is a great
yearning for the tobacco of Neewak, who is shaman and who plans to destroy
us.&nbsp; I have flour until I am sick, and sugar and molasses without
stint, yet is the heart of Moosu sore and his bed empty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Peace!&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;thou art weak of understanding
and a fool.&nbsp; Walk softly and wait, and we will grasp it all.&nbsp;
But grasp now, and we grasp little, and in the end it will be nothing.&nbsp;
Thou art a child in the way of the white man&rsquo;s wisdom.&nbsp; Hold
thy tongue and watch, and I will show you the way my brothers do overseas,
and, so doing, gather to themselves the riches of the earth.&nbsp; It
is what is called &ldquo;business,&rdquo; and what dost thou know about
business?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the next day he came in breathless.&nbsp; &lsquo;O master,
a strange thing happeneth in the igloo of Neewak, the shaman; wherefore
we are lost, and we have neither worn the warm furs nor tasted the good
tobacco, what of your madness for the molasses and flour.&nbsp; Go thou
and witness whilst I watch by the brew.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I went to the igloo of Neewak.&nbsp; And behold, he had
made his own still, fashioned cunningly after mine.&nbsp; And as he
beheld me he could ill conceal his triumph.&nbsp; For he was a man of
parts, and his sleep with the gods when in my igloo had not been sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was not disturbed, for I knew what I knew, and when
I returned to my own igloo, I descanted to Moosu, and said: &lsquo;Happily
the property right obtains amongst this people, who otherwise have been
blessed with but few of the institutions of men.&nbsp; And because of
this respect for property shall you and I wax fat, and, further, we
shall introduce amongst them new institutions that other peoples have
worked out through great travail and suffering.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Moosu understood dimly, till the shaman came forth, with
eyes flashing and a threatening note in his voice, and demanded to trade
with me.&nbsp; &lsquo;For look you,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;there be
of flour and molasses none in all the village.&nbsp; The like have you
gathered with a shrewd hand from my people, who have slept with your
gods and who now have nothing save large heads, and weak knees, and
a thirst for cold water that they cannot quench.&nbsp; This is not good,
and my voice has power among them; so it were well that we trade, you
and I, even as you have traded with them, for molasses and flour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I made answer: &lsquo;This be good talk, and wisdom abideth
in thy mouth.&nbsp; We will trade.&nbsp; For this much of flour and
molasses givest thou me the caddy of &ldquo;Star&rdquo; and the two
buckets of smoking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Moosu groaned, and when the trade was made and the shaman
departed, he upbraided me: &lsquo;Now, because of thy madness are we,
indeed, lost!&nbsp; Neewak maketh <i>hooch</i> on his own account, and
when the time is ripe, he will command the people to drink of no <i>hooch</i>
but his hooch.&nbsp; And in this way are we undone, and our goods worthless,
and our igloo mean, and the bed of Moosu cold and empty!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I answered: &lsquo;By the body of the wolf, say I, thou
art a fool, and thy father before thee, and thy children after thee,
down to the last generation.&nbsp; Thy wisdom is worse than no wisdom
and thine eyes blinded to business, of which I have spoken and whereof
thou knowest nothing.&nbsp; Go, thou son of a thousand fools, and drink
of the hooch that Neewak brews in his igloo, and thank thy gods that
thou hast a white man&rsquo;s wisdom to make soft the bed thou liest
in.&nbsp; Go! and when thou hast drunken, return with the taste still
on thy lips, that I may know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And two days after, Neewak sent greeting and invitation to
his igloo.&nbsp; Moosu went, but I sat alone, with the song of the still
in my ears, and the air thick with the shaman&rsquo;s tobacco; for trade
was slack that night, and no one dropped in but Angeit, a young hunter
that had faith in me.&nbsp; Later, Moosu came back, his speech thick
with chuckling and his eyes wrinkling with laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thou art a great man,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou
art a great man, O master, and because of thy greatness thou wilt not
condemn Moosu, thy servant, who ofttimes doubts and cannot be made to
understand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And wherefore now?&rsquo; I demanded.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hast
thou drunk overmuch?&nbsp; And are they sleeping sound in the igloo
of Neewak, the shaman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nay, they are angered and sore of body, and Chief Tummasook
has thrust his thumbs in the throat of Neewak, and sworn by the bones
of his ancestors to look upon his face no more.&nbsp; For behold! I
went to the igloo, and the brew simmered and bubbled, and the steam
journeyed through the gooseneck even as thy steam, and even as thine
it became water where it met the ice, and dropped into the pot at the
far end.&nbsp; And Neewak gave us to drink, and lo, it was not like
thine, for there was no bite to the tongue nor tingling to the eyeballs,
and of a truth it was water.&nbsp; So we drank, and we drank overmuch;
yet did we sit with cold hearts and solemn.&nbsp; And Neewak was perplexed
and a cloud came on his brow.&nbsp; And he took Tummasook and Ipsukuk
alone of all the company and set them apart, and bade them drink and
drink and drink.&nbsp; And they drank and drank and drank, and yet sat
solemn and cold, till Tummasook arose in wrath and demanded back the
furs and the tea he had paid.&nbsp; And Ipsukuk raised her voice, thin
and angry.&nbsp; And the company demanded back what they had given,
and there was a great commotion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Does the son of a dog deem me a whale?&rsquo; demanded
Tummasook, shoving back the skin flap and standing erect, his face black
and his brows angry.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wherefore I am filled, like a fish-bladder,
to bursting, till I can scarce walk, what of the weight within me.&nbsp;
Lalah!&nbsp; I have drunken as never before, yet are my eyes clear,
my knees strong, my hand steady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The shaman cannot send us to sleep with the gods,&rsquo;
the people complained, stringing in and joining us, &lsquo;and only
in thy igloo may the thing be done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I laughed to myself as I passed the <i>hooch</i> around
and the guests made merry.&nbsp; For in the flour I had traded to Neewak
I had mixed much soda that I had got from the woman Ipsukuk.&nbsp; So
how could his brew ferment when the soda kept it sweet?&nbsp; Or his
<i>hooch</i> be <i>hooch</i> when it would not sour?</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that our wealth flowed in without let or hindrance.&nbsp;
Furs we had without number, and the fancy-work of the women, all of
the chief&rsquo;s tea, and no end of meat.&nbsp; One day Moosu retold
for my benefit, and sadly mangled, the story of Joseph in Egypt, but
from it I got an idea, and soon I had half the tribe at work building
me great meat caches.&nbsp; And of all they hunted I got the lion&rsquo;s
share and stored it away.&nbsp; Nor was Moosu idle.&nbsp; He made himself
a pack of cards from birch bark, and taught Neewak the way to play seven-up.&nbsp;
He also inveigled the father of Tukeliketa into the game.&nbsp; And
one day he married the maiden, and the next day he moved into the shaman&rsquo;s
house, which was the finest in the village.&nbsp; The fall of Neewak
was complete, for he lost all his possessions, his walrus-hide drums,
his incantation tools&mdash;everything.&nbsp; And in the end he became
a hewer of wood and drawer of water at the beck and call of Moosu.&nbsp;
And Moosu&mdash;he set himself up as shaman, or high priest, and out
of his garbled Scripture created new gods and made incantation before
strange altars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I was well pleased, for I thought it good that church
and state go hand in hand, and I had certain plans of my own concerning
the state.&nbsp; Events were shaping as I had foreseen.&nbsp; Good temper
and smiling faces had vanished from the village.&nbsp; The people were
morose and sullen.&nbsp; There were quarrels and fighting, and things
were in an uproar night and day.&nbsp; Moosu&rsquo;s cards were duplicated
and the hunters fell to gambling among themselves.&nbsp; Tummasook beat
his wife horribly, and his mother&rsquo;s brother objected and smote
him with a tusk of walrus till he cried aloud in the night and was shamed
before the people.&nbsp; Also, amid such diversions no hunting was done,
and famine fell upon the land.&nbsp; The nights were long and dark,
and without meat no <i>hooch</i> could be bought; so they murmured against
the chief.&nbsp; This I had played for, and when they were well and
hungry, I summoned the whole village, made a great harangue, posed as
patriarch, and fed the famishing.&nbsp; Moosu made harangue likewise,
and because of this and the thing I had done I was made chief.&nbsp;
Moosu, who had the ear of God and decreed his judgments, anointed me
with whale blubber, and right blubberly he did it, not understanding
the ceremony.&nbsp; And between us we interpreted to the people the
new theory of the divine right of kings.&nbsp; There was <i>hooch</i>
galore, and meat and feastings, and they took kindly to the new order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see, O man, I have sat in the high places, and worn
the purple, and ruled populations.&nbsp; And I might yet be a king had
the tobacco held out, or had Moosu been more fool and less knave.&nbsp;
For he cast eyes upon Esanetuk, eldest daughter to Tummasook, and I
objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O brother,&rsquo; he explained, &lsquo;thou hast seen
fit to speak of introducing new institutions amongst this people, and
I have listened to thy words and gained wisdom thereby.&nbsp; Thou rulest
by the God-given right, and by the God-given right I marry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noted that he &lsquo;brothered&rsquo; me, and was angry
and put my foot down.&nbsp; But he fell back upon the people and made
incantations for three days, in which all hands joined; and then, speaking
with the voice of God, he decreed polygamy by divine fiat.&nbsp; But
he was shrewd, for he limited the number of wives by a property qualification,
and because of which he, above all men, was favoured by his wealth.&nbsp;
Nor could I fail to admire, though it was plain that power had turned
his head, and he would not be satisfied till all the power and all the
wealth rested in his own hands.&nbsp; So he became swollen with pride,
forgot it was I that had placed him there, and made preparations to
destroy me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was interesting, for the beggar was working out in
his own way an evolution of primitive society.&nbsp; Now I, by virtue
of the <i>hooch</i> monopoly, drew a revenue in which I no longer permitted
him to share.&nbsp; So he meditated for a while and evolved a system
of ecclesiastical taxation.&nbsp; He laid tithes upon the people, harangued
about fat firstlings and such things, and twisted whatever twisted texts
he had ever heard to serve his purpose.&nbsp; Even this I bore in silence,
but when he instituted what may be likened to a graduated income-tax,
I rebelled, and blindly, for this was what he worked for.&nbsp; Thereat,
he appealed to the people, and they, envious of my great wealth and
well taxed themselves, upheld him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why should we pay,&rsquo;
they asked, &lsquo;and not you?&nbsp; Does not the voice of God speak
through the lips of Moosu, the shaman?&rsquo;&nbsp; So I yielded.&nbsp;
But at the same time I raised the price of hooch, and lo, he was not
a whit behind me in raising my taxes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there was open war.&nbsp; I made a play for Neewak and
Tummasook, because of the traditionary rights they possessed; but Moosu
won out by creating a priesthood and giving them both high office.&nbsp;
The problem of authority presented itself to him, and he worked it out
as it has often been worked before.&nbsp; There was my mistake.&nbsp;
I should have been made shaman, and he chief; but I saw it too late,
and in the clash of spiritual and temporal power I was bound to be worsted.&nbsp;
A great controversy waged, but it quickly became one-sided.&nbsp; The
people remembered that he had anointed me, and it was clear to them
that the source of my authority lay, not in me, but in Moosu.&nbsp;
Only a few faithful ones clung to me, chief among whom Angeit was; while
he headed the popular party and set whispers afloat that I had it in
mind to overthrow him and set up my own gods, which were most unrighteous
gods.&nbsp; And in this the clever rascal had anticipated me, for it
was just what I had intended&mdash;forsake my kingship, you see, and
fight spiritual with spiritual.&nbsp; So he frightened the people with
the iniquities of my peculiar gods&mdash;especially the one he named
&lsquo;Biz-e-Nass&rsquo;&mdash;and nipped the scheme in the bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, it happened that Kluktu, youngest daughter to Tummasook,
had caught my fancy, and I likewise hers.&nbsp; So I made overtures,
but the ex-chief refused bluntly&mdash;after I had paid the purchase
price&mdash;and informed me that she was set aside for Moosu.&nbsp;
This was too much, and I was half of a mind to go to his igloo and slay
him with my naked hands; but I recollected that the tobacco was near
gone, and went home laughing.&nbsp; The next day he made incantation,
and distorted the miracle of the loaves and fishes till it became prophecy,
and I, reading between the lines, saw that it was aimed at the wealth
of meat stored in my caches.&nbsp; The people also read between the
lines, and, as he did not urge them to go on the hunt, they remained
at home, and few caribou or bear were brought in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I had plans of my own, seeing that not only the tobacco
but the flour and molasses were near gone.&nbsp; And further, I felt
it my duty to prove the white man&rsquo;s wisdom and bring sore distress
to Moosu, who had waxed high-stomached, what of the power I had given
him.&nbsp; So that night I went to my meat caches and toiled mightily,
and it was noted next day that all the dogs of the village were lazy.&nbsp;
No one suspected, and I toiled thus every night, and the dogs grew fat
and fatter, and the people lean and leaner.&nbsp; They grumbled and
demanded the fulfilment of prophecy, but Moosu restrained them, waiting
for their hunger to grow yet greater.&nbsp; Nor did he dream, to the
very last, of the trick I had been playing on the empty caches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When all was ready, I sent Angeit, and the faithful ones whom
I had fed privily, through the village to call assembly.&nbsp; And the
tribe gathered on a great space of beaten snow before my door, with
the meat caches towering stilt-legged in the rear.&nbsp; Moosu came
also, standing on the inner edge of the circle opposite me, confident
that I had some scheme afoot, and prepared at the first break to down
me.&nbsp; But I arose, giving him salutation before all men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;O Moosu, thou blessed of God,&rsquo; I began, &lsquo;doubtless
thou hast wondered in that I have called this convocation together;
and doubtless, because of my many foolishnesses, art thou prepared for
rash sayings and rash doings.&nbsp; Not so.&nbsp; It has been said,
that those the gods would destroy they first make mad.&nbsp; And I have
been indeed mad.&nbsp; I have crossed thy will, and scoffed at thy authority,
and done divers evil and wanton things.&nbsp; Wherefore, last night
a vision was vouchsafed me, and I have seen the wickedness of my ways.&nbsp;
And thou stoodst forth like a shining star, with brows aflame, and I
knew in mine own heart thy greatness.&nbsp; I saw all things clearly.&nbsp;
I knew that thou didst command the ear of God, and that when you spoke
he listened.&nbsp; And I remembered that whatever of the good deeds
that I had done, I had done through the grace of God, and the grace
of Moosu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, my children,&rsquo; I cried, turning to the people,
&lsquo;whatever right I have done, and whatever good I have done, have
been because of the counsel of Moosu.&nbsp; When I listened to him,
affairs prospered; when I closed my ears, and acted according to my
folly, things came to folly.&nbsp; By his advice it was that I laid
my store of meat, and in time of darkness fed the famishing.&nbsp; By
his grace it was that I was made chief.&nbsp; And what have I done with
my chiefship?&nbsp; Let me tell you.&nbsp; I have done nothing.&nbsp;
My head was turned with power, and I deemed myself greater than Moosu,
and, behold I have come to grief.&nbsp; My rule has been unwise, and
the gods are angered.&nbsp; Lo, ye are pinched with famine, and the
mothers are dry-breasted, and the little babies cry through the long
nights.&nbsp; Nor do I, who have hardened my heart against Moosu, know
what shall be done, nor in what manner of way grub shall be had.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this there was nodding and laughing, and the people put
their heads together, and I knew they whispered of the loaves and fishes.&nbsp;
I went on hastily.&nbsp; &lsquo;So I was made aware of my foolishness
and of Moosu&rsquo;s wisdom; of my own unfitness and of Moosu&rsquo;s
fitness.&nbsp; And because of this, being no longer mad, I make acknowledgment
and rectify evil.&nbsp; I did cast unrighteous eyes upon Kluktu, and
lo, she was sealed to Moosu.&nbsp; Yet is she mine, for did I not pay
to Tummasook the goods of purchase?&nbsp; But I am well unworthy of
her, and she shall go from the igloo of her father to the igloo of Moosu.&nbsp;
Can the moon shine in the sunshine?&nbsp; And further, Tummasook shall
keep the goods of purchase, and she be a free gift to Moosu, whom God
hath ordained her rightful lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And further yet, because I have used my wealth unwisely,
and to oppress ye, O my children, do I make gifts of the kerosene can
to Moosu, and the gooseneck, and the gun-barrel, and the copper kettle.&nbsp;
Therefore, I can gather to me no more possessions, and when ye are athirst
for <i>hooch</i>, he will quench ye and without robbery.&nbsp; For he
is a great man, and God speaketh through his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;And yet further, my heart is softened, and I have repented
me of my madness.&nbsp; I, who am a fool and a son of fools; I, who
am the slave of the bad god Biz-e-Nass; I, who see thy empty bellies
and knew not wherewith to fill them&mdash;why shall I be chief, and
sit above thee, and rule to thine own destruction?&nbsp; Why should
I do this, which is not good?&nbsp; But Moosu, who is shaman, and who
is wise above men, is so made that he can rule with a soft hand and
justly.&nbsp; And because of the things I have related do I make abdication
and give my chiefship to Moosu, who alone knoweth how ye may be fed
in this day when there be no meat in the land.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this there was a great clapping of hands, and the people
cried, &lsquo;<i>Kloshe</i>!&nbsp; <i>Kloshe</i>!&rsquo; which means
&lsquo;good.&rsquo;&nbsp; I had seen the wonder-worry in Moosu&rsquo;s
eyes; for he could not understand, and was fearful of my white man&rsquo;s
wisdom.&nbsp; I had met his wishes all along the line, and even anticipated
some; and standing there, self-shorn of all my power, he knew the time
did not favour to stir the people against me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before they could disperse I made announcement that while
the still went to Moosu, whatever <i>hooch</i> I possessed went to the
people.&nbsp; Moosu tried to protest at this, for never had we permitted
more than a handful to be drunk at a time; but they cried, &lsquo;<i>Kloshe</i>!
<i>Kloshe</i>!&rsquo; and made festival before my door.&nbsp; And while
they waxed uproarious without, as the liquor went to their heads, I
held council within with Angeit and the faithful ones.&nbsp; I set them
the tasks they were to do, and put into their mouths the words they
were to say.&nbsp; Then I slipped away to a place back in the woods
where I had two sleds, well loaded, with teams of dogs that were not
overfed.&nbsp; Spring was at hand, you see, and there was a crust to
the snow; so it was the best time to take the way south.&nbsp; Moreover,
the tobacco was gone.&nbsp; There I waited, for I had nothing to fear.&nbsp;
Did they bestir themselves on my trail, their dogs were too fat, and
themselves too lean, to overtake me; also, I deemed their bestirring
would be of an order for which I had made due preparation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First came a faithful one, running, and after him another.&nbsp;
&lsquo;O master,&rsquo; the first cried, breathless, &lsquo;there be
great confusion in the village, and no man knoweth his own mind, and
they be of many minds.&nbsp; Everybody hath drunken overmuch, and some
be stringing bows, and some be quarrelling one with another.&nbsp; Never
was there such a trouble.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the second one: &lsquo;And I did as thou biddest, O master,
whispering shrewd words in thirsty ears, and raising memories of the
things that were of old time.&nbsp; The woman Ipsukuk waileth her poverty
and the wealth that no longer is hers.&nbsp; And Tummasook thinketh
himself once again chief, and the people are hungry and rage up and
down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a third one: &lsquo;And Neewak hath overthrown the altars
of Moosu, and maketh incantation before the time-honoured and ancient
gods.&nbsp; And all the people remember the wealth that ran down their
throats, and which they possess no more.&nbsp; And first, Esanetuk,
who be <i>sick</i> <i>tumtum</i>, fought with Kluktu, and there was
much noise.&nbsp; And next, being daughters of the one mother, did they
fight with Tukeliketa.&nbsp; And after that did they three fall upon
Moosu, like wind-squalls, from every hand, till he ran forth from the
igloo, and the people mocked him.&nbsp; For a man who cannot command
his womankind is a fool.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then came Angeit: &lsquo;Great trouble hath befallen Moosu,
O master, for I have whispered to advantage, till the people came to
Moosu, saying they were hungry and demanding the fulfilment of prophecy.&nbsp;
And there was a loud shout of &ldquo;Itlwillie! Itlwillie!&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Meat.)&nbsp; So he cried peace to his womenfolk, who were overwrought
with anger and with hooch, and led the tribe even to thy meat caches.&nbsp;
And he bade the men open them and be fed.&nbsp; And lo, the caches were
empty.&nbsp; There was no meat.&nbsp; They stood without sound, the
people being frightened, and in the silence I lifted my voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;O Moosu, where is the meat?&nbsp; That there was meat we know.&nbsp;
Did we not hunt it and drag it in from the hunt?&nbsp; And it were a
lie to say one man hath eaten it; yet have we seen nor hide nor hair.&nbsp;
Where is the meat, O Moosu?&nbsp; Thou hast the ear of God.&nbsp; Where
is the meat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And the people cried, &ldquo;Thou hast the ear of God.&nbsp;
Where is the meat?&rdquo;&nbsp; And they put their heads together and
were afraid.&nbsp; Then I went among them, speaking fearsomely of the
unknown things, of the dead that come and go like shadows and do evil
deeds, till they cried aloud in terror and gathered all together, like
little children afraid of the dark.&nbsp; Neewak made harangue, laying
this evil that had come upon them at the door of Moosu.&nbsp; When he
had done, there was a furious commotion, and they took spears in their
hands, and tusks of walrus, and clubs, and stones from the beach.&nbsp;
But Moosu ran away home, and because he had not drunken of <i>hooch</i>
they could not catch him, and fell one over another and made haste slowly.&nbsp;
Even now they do howl without his igloo, and his woman-folk within,
and what of the noise, he cannot make himself heard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O Angeit, thou hast done well,&rsquo; I commanded.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Go now, taking this empty sled and the lean dogs, and ride fast
to the igloo of Moosu; and before the people, who are drunken, are aware,
throw him quick upon the sled and bring him to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I waited and gave good advice to the faithful ones till Angeit
returned.&nbsp; Moosu was on the sled, and I saw by the fingermarks
on his face that his womankind had done well by him.&nbsp; But he tumbled
off and fell in the snow at my feet, crying: &lsquo;O master, thou wilt
forgive Moosu, thy servant, for the wrong things he has done!&nbsp;
Thou art a great man!&nbsp; Surely wilt thou forgive!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Call me &ldquo;brother,&rdquo; Moosu&mdash;call me
&ldquo;brother,&rdquo;&rsquo; I chided, lifting him to his feet with
the toe of my moccasin.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wilt thou evermore obey?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yea, master,&rsquo; he whimpered, &lsquo;evermore.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then dispose thy body, so, across the sled,&rsquo;
I shifted the dogwhip to my right hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;And direct thy
face downwards, toward the snow.&nbsp; And make haste, for we journey
south this day.&rsquo;&nbsp; And when he was well fixed I laid the lash
upon him, reciting, at every stroke, the wrongs he had done me. &lsquo;This
for thy disobedience in general&mdash;whack!&nbsp; And this for thy
disobedience in particular&mdash;whack! whack!&nbsp; And this for Esanetuk!&nbsp;
And this for thy soul&rsquo;s welfare!&nbsp; And this for the grace
of thy authority!&nbsp; And this for Kluktu!&nbsp; And this for thy
rights God-given!&nbsp; And this for thy fat firstlings!&nbsp; And this
and this for thy income-tax and thy loaves and fishes!&nbsp; And this
for all thy disobedience!&nbsp; And this, finally, that thou mayest
henceforth walk softly and with understanding!&nbsp; Now cease thy sniffling
and get up!&nbsp; Gird on thy snowshoes and go to the fore and break
trail for the dogs.&nbsp; <i>Chook</i>!&nbsp; <i>Mush</i>-<i>on</i>!&nbsp;
Git!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thomas Stevens smiled quietly to himself as he lighted his fifth
cigar and sent curling smoke-rings ceilingward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how about the people of Tattarat?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Kind of rough, wasn&rsquo;t it, to leave them flat with famine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he answered, laughing, between two smoke-rings, &ldquo;Were there
not the fat dogs?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>THE FAITH OF MEN</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what we&rsquo;ll do; we&rsquo;ll shake for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That suits me,&rdquo; said the second man, turning, as he
spoke, to the Indian that was mending snowshoes in a corner of the cabin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here, you Billebedam, take a run down to Oleson&rsquo;s cabin
like a good fellow, and tell him we want to borrow his dice box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sudden request in the midst of a council on wages of men, wood,
and grub surprised Billebedam.&nbsp; Besides, it was early in the day,
and he had never known white men of the calibre of Pentfield and Hutchinson
to dice and play till the day&rsquo;s work was done.&nbsp; But his face
was impassive as a Yukon Indian&rsquo;s should be, as he pulled on his
mittens and went out the door.</p>
<p>Though eight o&rsquo;clock, it was still dark outside, and the cabin
was lighted by a tallow candle thrust into an empty whisky bottle.&nbsp;
It stood on the pine-board table in the middle of a disarray of dirty
tin dishes.&nbsp; Tallow from innumerable candles had dripped down the
long neck of the bottle and hardened into a miniature glacier.&nbsp;
The small room, which composed the entire cabin, was as badly littered
as the table; while at one end, against the wall, were two bunks, one
above the other, with the blankets turned down just as the two men had
crawled out in the morning.</p>
<p>Lawrence Pentfield and Corry Hutchinson were millionaires, though
they did not look it.&nbsp; There seemed nothing unusual about them,
while they would have passed muster as fair specimens of lumbermen in
any Michigan camp.&nbsp; But outside, in the darkness, where holes yawned
in the ground, were many men engaged in windlassing muck and gravel
and gold from the bottoms of the holes where other men received fifteen
dollars per day for scraping it from off the bedrock.&nbsp; Each day
thousands of dollars&rsquo; worth of gold were scraped from bedrock
and windlassed to the surface, and it all belonged to Pentfield and
Hutchinson, who took their rank among the richest kings of Bonanza.</p>
<p>Pentfield broke the silence that followed on Billebedam&rsquo;s departure
by heaping the dirty plates higher on the table and drumming a tattoo
on the cleared space with his knuckles.&nbsp; Hutchinson snuffed the
smoky candle and reflectively rubbed the soot from the wick between
thumb and forefinger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, I wish we could both go out!&rdquo; he abruptly exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That would settle it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pentfield looked at him darkly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for your cursed obstinacy, it&rsquo;d
be settled anyway.&nbsp; All you have to do is get up and go.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll look after things, and next year I can go out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I go?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no one waiting for me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your people,&rdquo; Pentfield broke in roughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like you have,&rdquo; Hutchinson went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;A girl,
I mean, and you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pentfield shrugged his shoulders gloomily.&nbsp; &ldquo;She can wait,
I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s been waiting two years now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And another won&rsquo;t age her beyond recognition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;d be three years.&nbsp; Think of it, old man, three
years in this end of the earth, this falling-off place for the damned!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Hutchinson threw up his arm in an almost articulate groan.</p>
<p>He was several years younger than his partner, not more than twenty-six,
and there was a certain wistfulness in his face that comes into the
faces of men when they yearn vainly for the things they have been long
denied.&nbsp; This same wistfulness was in Pentfield&rsquo;s face, and
the groan of it was articulate in the heave of his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dreamed last night I was in Zinkand&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The music playing, glasses clinking, voices humming, women laughing,
and I was ordering eggs&mdash;yes, sir, eggs, fried and boiled and poached
and scrambled, and in all sorts of ways, and downing them as fast as
they arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have ordered salads and green things,&rdquo; Hutchinson
criticized hungrily, &ldquo;with a big, rare, Porterhouse, and young
onions and radishes,&mdash;the kind your teeth sink into with a crunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have followed the eggs with them, I guess, if I
hadn&rsquo;t awakened,&rdquo; Pentfield replied.</p>
<p>He picked up a trail-scarred banjo from the floor and began to strum
a few wandering notes.&nbsp; Hutchinson winced and breathed heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit it!&rdquo; he burst out with sudden fury, as the other
struck into a gaily lifting swing.&nbsp; &ldquo;It drives me mad.&nbsp;
I can&rsquo;t stand it&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pentfield tossed the banjo into a bunk and quoted:-</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hear me babble what the weakest won&rsquo;t confess&mdash;<br />
I am Memory and Torment&mdash;I am Town!<br />
I am all that ever went with evening dress!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other man winced where he sat and dropped his head forward on
the table.&nbsp; Pentfield resumed the monotonous drumming with his
knuckles.&nbsp; A loud snap from the door attracted his attention.&nbsp;
The frost was creeping up the inside in a white sheet, and he began
to hum:-</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The flocks are folded, boughs are bare,<br />
The salmon takes the sea;<br />
And oh, my fair, would I somewhere<br />
Might house my heart with thee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Silence fell and was not again broken till Billebedam arrived and
threw the dice box on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um much cold,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oleson um speak
to me, um say um Yukon freeze last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear that, old man!&rdquo; Pentfield cried, slapping Hutchinson
on the shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whoever wins can be hitting the trail
for God&rsquo;s country this time tomorrow morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He picked up the box, briskly rattling the dice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Straight poker dice,&rdquo; Hutchinson answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go
on and roll them out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pentfield swept the dishes from the table with a crash and rolled
out the five dice.&nbsp; Both looked tragedy.&nbsp; The shake was without
a pair and five-spot high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stiff!&rdquo; Pentfield groaned.</p>
<p>After much deliberating Pentfield picked up all the five dice and
put them in the box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d shake to the five if I were you,&rdquo; Hutchinson
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you wouldn&rsquo;t, not when you see this,&rdquo; Pentfield
replied, shaking out the dice.</p>
<p>Again they were without a pair, running this time in unbroken sequence
from two to six.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A second stiff!&rdquo; he groaned.&nbsp; &ldquo;No use your
shaking, Corry.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other man gathered up the dice without a word, rattled them,
rolled them out on the table with a flourish, and saw that he had likewise
shaken a six-high stiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tied you, anyway, but I&rsquo;ll have to do better than that,&rdquo;
he said, gathering in four of them and shaking to the six.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
here&rsquo;s what beats you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they rolled out deuce, tray, four, and five&mdash;a stiff still
and no better nor worse than Pentfield&rsquo;s throw.</p>
<p>Hutchinson sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t happen once in a million times,&rdquo; said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor in a million lives,&rdquo; Pentfield added, catching up
the dice and quickly throwing them out.&nbsp; Three fives appeared,
and, after much delay, he was rewarded by a fourth five on the second
shake.&nbsp; Hutchinson seemed to have lost his last hope.</p>
<p>But three sixes turned up on his first shake.&nbsp; A great doubt
rose in the other&rsquo;s eyes, and hope returned into his.&nbsp; He
had one more shake.&nbsp; Another six and he would go over the ice to
salt water and the States.</p>
<p>He rattled the dice in the box, made as though to cast them, hesitated,
and continued rattle them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&nbsp; Go on!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t take all night about
it!&rdquo; Pentfield cried sharply, bending his nails on the table,
so tight was the clutch with which he strove to control himself.</p>
<p>The dice rolled forth, an upturned six meeting their eyes.&nbsp;
Both men sat staring at it.&nbsp; There was a long silence.&nbsp; Hutchinson
shot a covert glance at his partner, who, still more covertly, caught
it, and pursed up his lips in an attempt to advertise his unconcern.</p>
<p>Hutchinson laughed as he got up on his feet.&nbsp; It was a nervous,
apprehensive laugh.&nbsp; It was a case where it was more awkward to
win than lose.&nbsp; He walked over to his partner, who whirled upon
him fiercely:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you just shut up, Corry!&nbsp; I know all you&rsquo;re
going to say&mdash;that you&rsquo;d rather stay in and let me go, and
all that; so don&rsquo;t say it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve your own people
in Detroit to see, and that&rsquo;s enough.&nbsp; Besides, you can do
for me the very thing I expected to do if I went out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pentfield read the full question in his partner&rsquo;s eyes, and
answered:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that very thing.&nbsp; You can bring her in to me.&nbsp;
The only difference will be a Dawson wedding instead of a San Franciscan
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, man alike!&rdquo; Corry Hutchinson objected &ldquo;how
under the sun can I bring her in?&nbsp; We&rsquo;re not exactly brother
and sister, seeing that I have not even met her, and it wouldn&rsquo;t
be just the proper thing, you know, for us to travel together.&nbsp;
Of course, it would be all right&mdash;you and I know that; but think
of the looks of it, man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pentfield swore under his breath, consigning the looks of it to a
less frigid region than Alaska.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if you&rsquo;ll just listen and not get astride that
high horse of yours so blamed quick,&rdquo; his partner went on, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
see that the only fair thing under the circumstances is for me to let
you go out this year.&nbsp; Next year is only a year away, and then
I can take my fling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pentfield shook his head, though visibly swayed by the temptation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do, Corry, old man.&nbsp; I appreciate your
kindness and all that, but it won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d be ashamed
every time I thought of you slaving away in here in my place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thought seemed suddenly to strike him.&nbsp; Burrowing into his
bunk and disrupting it in his eagerness, he secured a writing-pad and
pencil, and sitting down at the table, began to write with swiftness
and certitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, thrusting the scrawled letter into his
partner&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;You just deliver that and everything&rsquo;ll
be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hutchinson ran his eye over it and laid it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know the brother will be willing to make that beastly
trip in here?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll do it for me&mdash;and for his sister,&rdquo;
Pentfield replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, he&rsquo;s tenderfoot, and
I wouldn&rsquo;t trust her with him alone.&nbsp; But with you along
it will be an easy trip and a safe one.&nbsp; As soon as you get out,
you&rsquo;ll go to her and prepare her.&nbsp; Then you can take your
run east to your own people, and in the spring she and her brother&rsquo;ll
be ready to start with you.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll like her, I know, right
from the jump; and from that, you&rsquo;ll know her as soon as you lay
eyes on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying he opened the back of his watch and exposed a girl&rsquo;s
photograph pasted on the inside of the case.&nbsp; Corry Hutchinson
gazed at it with admiration welling up in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mabel is her name,&rdquo; Pentfield went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
it&rsquo;s just as well you should know how to find the house.&nbsp;
Soon as you strike &rsquo;Frisco, take a cab, and just say, &lsquo;Holmes&rsquo;s
place, Myrdon Avenue&rsquo;&mdash;I doubt if the Myrdon Avenue is necessary.&nbsp;
The cabby&rsquo;ll know where Judge Holmes lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And say,&rdquo; Pentfield continued, after a pause, &ldquo;it
won&rsquo;t be a bad idea for you to get me a few little things which
a&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A married man should have in his business,&rdquo; Hutchinson
blurted out with a grin.</p>
<p>Pentfield grinned back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, napkins and tablecloths and sheets and pillowslips,
and such things.&nbsp; And you might get a good set of china.&nbsp;
You know it&rsquo;ll come hard for her to settle down to this sort of
thing.&nbsp; You can freight them in by steamer around by Bering Sea.&nbsp;
And, I say, what&rsquo;s the matter with a piano?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hutchinson seconded the idea heartily.&nbsp; His reluctance had vanished,
and he was warming up to his mission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&nbsp; Lawrence,&rdquo; he said at the conclusion
of the council, as they both rose to their feet, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring
back that girl of yours in style.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll do the cooking and
take care of the dogs, and all that brother&rsquo;ll have to do will
be to see to her comfort and do for her whatever I&rsquo;ve forgotten.&nbsp;
And I&rsquo;ll forget damn little, I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day Lawrence Pentfield shook hands with him for the last
time and watched him, running with his dogs, disappear up the frozen
Yukon on his way to salt water and the world.&nbsp; Pentfield went back
to his Bonanza mine, which was many times more dreary than before, and
faced resolutely into the long winter.&nbsp; There was work to be done,
men to superintend, and operations to direct in burrowing after the
erratic pay streak; but his heart was not in the work.&nbsp; Nor was
his heart in any work till the tiered logs of a new cabin began to rise
on the hill behind the mine.&nbsp; It was a grand cabin, warmly built
and divided into three comfortable rooms.&nbsp; Each log was hand-hewed
and squared&mdash;an expensive whim when the axemen received a daily
wage of fifteen dollars; but to him nothing could be too costly for
the home in which Mabel Holmes was to live.</p>
<p>So he went about with the building of the cabin, singing, &ldquo;And
oh, my fair, would I somewhere might house my heart with thee!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Also, he had a calendar pinned on the wall above the table, and his
first act each morning was to check off the day and to count the days
that were left ere his partner would come booming down the Yukon ice
in the spring.&nbsp; Another whim of his was to permit no one to sleep
in the new cabin on the hill.&nbsp; It must be as fresh for her occupancy
as the square-hewed wood was fresh; and when it stood complete, he put
a padlock on the door.&nbsp; No one entered save himself, and he was
wont to spend long hours there, and to come forth with his face strangely
radiant and in his eyes a glad, warm light.</p>
<p>In December he received a letter from Corry Hutchinson.&nbsp; He
had just seen Mabel Holmes.&nbsp; She was all she ought to be, to be
Lawrence Pentfield&rsquo;s wife, he wrote.&nbsp; He was enthusiastic,
and his letter sent the blood tingling through Pentfield&rsquo;s veins.&nbsp;
Other letters followed, one on the heels of another, and sometimes two
or three together when the mail lumped up.&nbsp; And they were all in
the same tenor.&nbsp; Corry had just come from Myrdon Avenue; Corry
was just going to Myrdon Avenue; or Corry was at Myrdon Avenue.&nbsp;
And he lingered on and on in San Francisco, nor even mentioned his trip
to Detroit.</p>
<p>Lawrence Pentfield began to think that his partner was a great deal
in the company of Mabel Holmes for a fellow who was going east to see
his people.&nbsp; He even caught himself worrying about it at times,
though he would have worried more had he not known Mabel and Corry so
well.&nbsp; Mabel&rsquo;s letters, on the other hand, had a great deal
to say about Corry.&nbsp; Also, a thread of timidity that was near to
disinclination ran through them concerning the trip in over the ice
and the Dawson marriage.&nbsp; Pentfield wrote back heartily, laughing
at her fears, which he took to be the mere physical ones of danger and
hardship rather than those bred of maidenly reserve.</p>
<p>But the long winter and tedious wait, following upon the two previous
long winters, were telling upon him.&nbsp; The superintendence of the
men and the pursuit of the pay streak could not break the irk of the
daily round, and the end of January found him making occasional trips
to Dawson, where he could forget his identity for a space at the gambling
tables.&nbsp; Because he could afford to lose, he won, and &ldquo;Pentfield&rsquo;s
luck&rdquo; became a stock phrase among the faro players.</p>
<p>His luck ran with him till the second week in February.&nbsp; How
much farther it might have run is conjectural; for, after one big game,
he never played again.</p>
<p>It was in the Opera House that it occurred, and for an hour it had
seemed that he could not place his money on a card without making the
card a winner.&nbsp; In the lull at the end of a deal, while the game-keeper
was shuffling the deck, Nick Inwood the owner of the game, remarked,
apropos of nothing:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Pentfield, I see that partner of yours has been cutting
up monkey-shines on the outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust Corry to have a good time,&rdquo; Pentfield had answered;
&ldquo;especially when he has earned it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every man to his taste,&rdquo; Nick Inwood laughed; &ldquo;but
I should scarcely call getting married a good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corry married!&rdquo; Pentfield cried, incredulous and yet
surprised out of himself for the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Inwood said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw it in the &rsquo;Frisco
paper that came in over the ice this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and who&rsquo;s the girl?&rdquo; Pentfield demanded,
somewhat with the air of patient fortitude with which one takes the
bait of a catch and is aware at the time of the large laugh bound to
follow at his expense.</p>
<p>Nick Inwood pulled the newspaper from his pocket and began looking
it over, saying:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a remarkable memory for names, but it seems
to me it&rsquo;s something like Mabel&mdash;Mabel&mdash;oh yes, here
it&mdash;&lsquo;Mabel Holmes, daughter of Judge Holmes,&rsquo;&mdash;whoever
he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lawrence Pentfield never turned a hair, though he wondered how any
man in the North could know her name.&nbsp; He glanced coolly from face
to face to note any vagrant signs of the game that was being played
upon him, but beyond a healthy curiosity the faces betrayed nothing.&nbsp;
Then he turned to the gambler and said in cold, even tones:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inwood, I&rsquo;ve got an even five hundred here that says
the print of what you have just said is not in that paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gambler looked at him in quizzical surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go
&rsquo;way, child.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want your money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; Pentfield sneered, returning to the game
and laying a couple of bets.</p>
<p>Nick Inwood&rsquo;s face flushed, and, as though doubting his senses,
he ran careful eyes over the print of a quarter of a column.&nbsp; Then
be turned on Lawrence Pentfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Pentfield,&rdquo; he said, in a quiet, nervous
manner; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t allow that, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow what?&rdquo; Pentfield demanded brutally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You implied that I lied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; came the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
merely implied that you were trying to be clumsily witty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make your bets, gentlemen,&rdquo; the dealer protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I tell you it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Nick Inwood insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have told you I&rsquo;ve five hundred that says it&rsquo;s
not in that paper,&rdquo; Pentfield answered, at the same time throwing
a heavy sack of dust on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to take your money,&rdquo; was the retort, as Inwood
thrust the newspaper into Pentfield&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Pentfield saw, though he could not quite bring himself to believe.&nbsp;
Glancing through the headline, &ldquo;Young Lochinvar came out of the
North,&rdquo; and skimming the article until the names of Mabel Holmes
and Corry Hutchinson, coupled together, leaped squarely before his eyes,
he turned to the top of the page.&nbsp; It was a San Francisco paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The money&rsquo;s yours, Inwood,&rdquo; he remarked, with
a short laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no telling what that partner
of mine will do when he gets started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he returned to the article and read it word for word, very slowly
and very carefully.&nbsp; He could no longer doubt.&nbsp; Beyond dispute,
Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of the Bonanza
kings,&rdquo; it described him, &ldquo;a partner with Lawrence Pentfield
(whom San Francisco society has not yet forgotten), and interested with
that gentleman in other rich, Klondike properties.&rdquo;&nbsp; Further,
and at the end, he read, &ldquo;It is whispered that Mr. and Mrs. Hutchinson
will, after a brief trip east to Detroit, make their real honeymoon
journey into the fascinating Klondike country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back again; keep my place for me,&rdquo; Pentfield
said, rising to his feet and taking his sack, which meantime had hit
the blower and came back lighter by five hundred dollars.</p>
<p>He went down the street and bought a Seattle paper.&nbsp; It contained
the same facts, though somewhat condensed.&nbsp; Corry and Mabel were
indubitably married.&nbsp; Pentfield returned to the Opera House and
resumed his seat in the game.&nbsp; He asked to have the limit removed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to get action,&rdquo; Nick Inwood laughed, as he nodded
assent to the dealer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was going down to the A. C. store,
but now I guess I&rsquo;ll stay and watch you do your worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Lawrence Pentfield did at the end of two hours&rsquo; plunging,
when the dealer bit the end off a fresh cigar and struck a match as
he announced that the bank was broken.&nbsp; Pentfield cashed in for
forty thousand, shook hands with Nick Inwood, and stated that it was
the last time he would ever play at his game or at anybody&rsquo;s else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>No one knew nor guessed that he had been hit, much less hit hard.&nbsp;
There was no apparent change in his manner.&nbsp; For a week he went
about his work much as he had always done, when he read an account of
the marriage in a Portland paper.&nbsp; Then he called in a friend to
take charge of his mine and departed up the Yukon behind his dogs.&nbsp;
He held to the Salt Water trail till White River was reached, into which
he turned.&nbsp; Five days later he came upon a hunting camp of the
White River Indians.&nbsp; In the evening there was a feast, and he
sat in honour beside the chief; and next morning he headed his dogs
back toward the Yukon.&nbsp; But he no longer travelled alone.&nbsp;
A young squaw fed his dogs for him that night and helped to pitch camp.&nbsp;
She had been mauled by a bear in her childhood and suffered from a slight
limp.&nbsp; Her name was Lashka, and she was diffident at first with
the strange white man that had come out of the Unknown, married her
with scarcely a look or word, and now was carrying her back with him
into the Unknown.</p>
<p>But Lashka&rsquo;s was better fortune than falls to most Indian girls
that mate with white men in the Northland.&nbsp; No sooner was Dawson
reached than the barbaric marriage that had joined them was re-solemnized,
in the white man&rsquo;s fashion, before a priest.&nbsp; From Dawson,
which to her was all a marvel and a dream, she was taken directly to
the Bonanza claim and installed in the square-hewed cabin on the hill.</p>
<p>The nine days&rsquo; wonder that followed arose not so much out of
the fact of the squaw whom Lawrence Pentfield had taken to bed and board
as out of the ceremony that had legalized the tie.&nbsp; The properly
sanctioned marriage was the one thing that passed the community&rsquo;s
comprehension.&nbsp; But no one bothered Pentfield about it.&nbsp; So
long as a man&rsquo;s vagaries did no special hurt to the community,
the community let the man alone, nor was Pentfield barred from the cabins
of men who possessed white wives.&nbsp; The marriage ceremony removed
him from the status of squaw-man and placed him beyond moral reproach,
though there were men that challenged his taste where women were concerned.</p>
<p>No more letters arrived from the outside.&nbsp; Six sledloads of
mails had been lost at the Big Salmon.&nbsp; Besides, Pentfield knew
that Corry and his bride must by that time have started in over the
trail.&nbsp; They were even then on their honeymoon trip&mdash;the honeymoon
trip he had dreamed of for himself through two dreary years.&nbsp; His
lip curled with bitterness at the thought; but beyond being kinder to
Lashka he gave no sign.</p>
<p>March had passed and April was nearing its end, when, one spring
morning, Lashka asked permission to go down the creek several miles
to Siwash Pete&rsquo;s cabin.&nbsp; Pete&rsquo;s wife, a Stewart River
woman, had sent up word that something was wrong with her baby, and
Lashka, who was pre-eminently a mother-woman and who held herself to
be truly wise in the matter of infantile troubles, missed no opportunity
of nursing the children of other women as yet more fortunate than she.</p>
<p>Pentfield harnessed his dogs, and with Lashka behind took the trail
down the creek bed of Bonanza.&nbsp; Spring was in the air.&nbsp; The
sharpness had gone out of the bite of the frost and though snow still
covered the land, the murmur and trickling of water told that the iron
grip of winter was relaxing.&nbsp; The bottom was dropping out of the
trail, and here and there a new trail had been broken around open holes.&nbsp;
At such a place, where there was not room for two sleds to pass, Pentfield
heard the jingle of approaching bells and stopped his dogs.</p>
<p>A team of tired-looking dogs appeared around the narrow bend, followed
by a heavily-loaded sled.&nbsp; At the gee-pole was a man who steered
in a manner familiar to Pentfield, and behind the sled walked two women.&nbsp;
His glance returned to the man at the gee-pole.&nbsp; It was Corry.&nbsp;
Pentfield got on his feet and waited.&nbsp; He was glad that Lashka
was with him.&nbsp; The meeting could not have come about better had
it been planned, he thought.&nbsp; And as he waited he wondered what
they would say, what they would be able to say.&nbsp; As for himself
there was no need to say anything.&nbsp; The explaining was all on their
side, and he was ready to listen to them.</p>
<p>As they drew in abreast, Corry recognized him and halted the dogs.&nbsp;
With a &ldquo;Hello, old man,&rdquo; he held out his hand.</p>
<p>Pentfield shook it, but without warmth or speech.&nbsp; By this time
the two women had come up, and he noticed that the second one was Dora
Holmes.&nbsp; He doffed his fur cap, the flaps of which were flying,
shook hands with her, and turned toward Mabel.&nbsp; She swayed forward,
splendid and radiant, but faltered before his outstretched hand.&nbsp;
He had intended to say, &ldquo;How do you do, Mrs. Hutchinson?&rdquo;&mdash;but
somehow, the Mrs. Hutchinson had choked him, and all he had managed
to articulate was the &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was all the constraint and awkwardness in the situation he
could have wished.&nbsp; Mabel betrayed the agitation appropriate to
her position, while Dora, evidently brought along as some sort of peacemaker,
was saying:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what is the matter, Lawrence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he could answer, Corry plucked him by the sleeve and drew
him aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, old man, what&rsquo;s this mean?&rdquo; Corry demanded
in a low tone, indicating Lashka with his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hardly see, Corry, where you can have any concern in
the matter,&rdquo; Pentfield answered mockingly.</p>
<p>But Corry drove straight to the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that squaw doing on your sled?&nbsp; A nasty job you&rsquo;ve
given me to explain all this away.&nbsp; I only hope it can be explained
away.&nbsp; Who is she?&nbsp; Whose squaw is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Lawrence Pentfield delivered his stroke, and he delivered it
with a certain calm elation of spirit that seemed somewhat to compensate
for the wrong that had been done him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is my squaw,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;Mrs. Pentfield, if
you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corry Hutchinson gasped, and Pentfield left him and returned to the
two women.&nbsp; Mabel, with a worried expression on her face, seemed
holding herself aloof.&nbsp; He turned to Dora and asked, quite genially,
as though all the world was sunshine:- &ldquo;How did you stand the
trip, anyway?&nbsp; Have any trouble to sleep warm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, how did Mrs. Hutchinson stand it?&rdquo; he asked next,
his eyes on Mabel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you dear ninny!&rdquo; Dora cried, throwing her arms around
him and hugging him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you saw it, too!&nbsp; I thought
something was the matter, you were acting so strangely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I hardly understand,&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was corrected in next day&rsquo;s paper,&rdquo; Dora chattered
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;We did not dream you would see it.&nbsp; All the other
papers had it correctly, and of course that one miserable paper was
the very one you saw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment!&nbsp; What do you mean?&rdquo; Pentfield demanded,
a sudden fear at his heart, for he felt himself on the verge of a great
gulf.</p>
<p>But Dora swept volubly on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, when it became known that Mabel and I were going to Klondike,
<i>Every</i> <i>Other</i> <i>Week</i> said that when we were gone, it
would be lovely on Myrdon Avenue, meaning, of course, lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Mrs. Hutchinson,&rdquo; Dora answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
you thought it was Mabel all the time&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely the way of it,&rdquo; Pentfield replied slowly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I can see now.&nbsp; The reporter got the names mixed.&nbsp;
The Seattle and Portland paper copied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood silently for a minute.&nbsp; Mabel&rsquo;s face was turned
toward him again, and he could see the glow of expectancy in it.&nbsp;
Corry was deeply interested in the ragged toe of one of his moccasins,
while Dora was stealing sidelong glances at the immobile face of Lashka
sitting on the sled.&nbsp; Lawrence Pentfield stared straight out before
him into a dreary future, through the grey vistas of which he saw himself
riding on a sled behind running dogs with lame Lashka by his side.</p>
<p>Then he spoke, quite simply, looking Mabel in the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry.&nbsp; I did not dream it.&nbsp; I thought
you had married Corry.&nbsp; That is Mrs. Pentfield sitting on the sled
over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mabel Holmes turned weakly toward her sister, as though all the fatigue
of her great journey had suddenly descended on her.&nbsp; Dora caught
her around the waist.&nbsp; Corry Hutchinson was still occupied with
his moccasins.&nbsp; Pentfield glanced quickly from face to face, then
turned to his sled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t stop here all day, with Pete&rsquo;s baby waiting,&rdquo;
he said to Lashka.</p>
<p>The long whip-lash hissed out, the dogs sprang against the breast
bands, and the sled lurched and jerked ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say, Corry,&rdquo; Pentfield called back, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d
better occupy the old cabin.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not been used for some
time.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve built a new one on the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>TOO MUCH GOLD</h2>
<p>This being a story&mdash;and a truer one than it may appear&mdash;of
a mining country, it is quite to be expected that it will be a hard-luck
story.&nbsp; But that depends on the point of view.&nbsp; Hard luck
is a mild way of terming it so far as Kink Mitchell and Hootchinoo Bill
are concerned; and that they have a decided opinion on the subject is
a matter of common knowledge in the Yukon country.</p>
<p>It was in the fall of 1896 that the two partners came down to the
east bank of the Yukon, and drew a Peterborough canoe from a moss-covered
cache.&nbsp; They were not particularly pleasant-looking objects.&nbsp;
A summer&rsquo;s prospecting, filled to repletion with hardship and
rather empty of grub, had left their clothes in tatters and themselves
worn and cadaverous.&nbsp; A nimbus of mosquitoes buzzed about each
man&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Their faces were coated with blue clay.&nbsp;
Each carried a lump of this damp clay, and, whenever it dried and fell
from their faces, more was daubed on in its place.&nbsp; There was a
querulous plaint in their voices, an irritability of movement and gesture,
that told of broken sleep and a losing struggle with the little winged
pests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them skeeters&rsquo;ll be the death of me yet,&rdquo; Kink
Mitchell whimpered, as the canoe felt the current on her nose, and leaped
out from the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, cheer up.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re about done,&rdquo; Hootchinoo
Bill answered, with an attempted heartiness in his funereal tones that
was ghastly.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be in Forty Mile in forty minutes,
and then&mdash;cursed little devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One hand left his paddle and landed on the back of his neck with
a sharp slap.&nbsp; He put a fresh daub of clay on the injured part,
swearing sulphurously the while.&nbsp; Kink Mitchell was not in the
least amused.&nbsp; He merely improved the opportunity by putting a
thicker coating of clay on his own neck.</p>
<p>They crossed the Yukon to its west bank, shot down-stream with easy
stroke, and at the end of forty minutes swung in close to the left around
the tail of an island.&nbsp; Forty Mile spread itself suddenly before
them.&nbsp; Both men straightened their backs and gazed at the sight.&nbsp;
They gazed long and carefully, drifting with the current, in their faces
an expression of mingled surprise and consternation slowly gathering.&nbsp;
Not a thread of smoke was rising from the hundreds of log-cabins.&nbsp;
There was no sound of axes biting sharply into wood, of hammering and
sawing.&nbsp; Neither dogs nor men loitered before the big store.&nbsp;
No steamboats lay at the bank, no canoes, nor scows, nor poling-boats.&nbsp;
The river was as bare of craft as the town was of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of looks like Gabriel&rsquo;s tooted his little horn,
and you an&rsquo; me has turned up missing,&rdquo; remarked Hootchinoo
Bill.</p>
<p>His remark was casual, as though there was nothing unusual about
the occurrence.&nbsp; Kink Mitchell&rsquo;s reply was just as casual
as though he, too, were unaware of any strange perturbation of spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as they was all Baptists, then, and took the boats to
go by water,&rdquo; was his contribution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My ol&rsquo; dad was a Baptist,&rdquo; Hootchinoo Bill supplemented.&nbsp;
&ldquo;An&rsquo; he always did hold it was forty thousand miles nearer
that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the end of their levity.&nbsp; They ran the canoe in and
climbed the high earth bank.&nbsp; A feeling of awe descended upon them
as they walked the deserted streets.&nbsp; The sunlight streamed placidly
over the town.&nbsp; A gentle wind tapped the halyards against the flagpole
before the closed doors of the Caledonia Dance Hall.&nbsp; Mosquitoes
buzzed, robins sang, and moose birds tripped hungrily among the cabins;
but there was no human life nor sign of human life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just dyin&rsquo; for a drink,&rdquo; Hootchinoo
Bill said and unconsciously his voice sank to a hoarse whisper.</p>
<p>His partner nodded his head, loth to hear his own voice break the
stillness.&nbsp; They trudged on in uneasy silence till surprised by
an open door.&nbsp; Above this door, and stretching the width of the
building, a rude sign announced the same as the &ldquo;Monte Carlo.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But beside the door, hat over eyes, chair tilted back, a man sat sunning
himself.&nbsp; He was an old man.&nbsp; Beard and hair were long and
white and patriarchal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t ol&rsquo; Jim Cummings, turned up like us,
too late for Resurrection!&rdquo; said Kink Mitchell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most like he didn&rsquo;t hear Gabriel tootin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
was Hootchinoo Bill&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Jim!&nbsp; Wake up!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>The old man unlimbered lamely, blinking his eyes and murmuring automatically:
&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll ye have, gents?&nbsp; What&rsquo;ll ye have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They followed him inside and ranged up against the long bar where
of yore a half-dozen nimble bar-keepers found little time to loaf.&nbsp;
The great room, ordinarily aroar with life, was still and gloomy as
a tomb.&nbsp; There was no rattling of chips, no whirring of ivory balls.&nbsp;
Roulette and faro tables were like gravestones under their canvas covers.&nbsp;
No women&rsquo;s voices drifted merrily from the dance-room behind.&nbsp;
Ol&rsquo; Jim Cummings wiped a glass with palsied hands, and Kink Mitchell
scrawled his initials on the dust-covered bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the girls?&rdquo; Hootchinoo Bill shouted, with
affected geniality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone,&rdquo; was the ancient bar-keeper&rsquo;s reply, in
a voice thin and aged as himself, and as unsteady as his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Bidwell and Barlow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Sweetwater Charley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your daughter Sally, then, and her little kid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone, all gone.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old man shook his head sadly,
rummaging in an absent way among the dusty bottles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Sardanapolis!&nbsp; Where?&rdquo; Kink Mitchell exploded,
unable longer to restrain himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say
you&rsquo;ve had the plague?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, ain&rsquo;t you heerd?&rdquo;&nbsp; The old man chuckled
quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;They-all&rsquo;s gone to Dawson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What-like is that?&rdquo; Bill demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;A creek?
or a bar? or a place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t never heered of Dawson, eh?&rdquo;&nbsp; The old
man chuckled exasperatingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, Dawson&rsquo;s a town,
a city, bigger&rsquo;n Forty Mile.&nbsp; Yes, sir, bigger&rsquo;n Forty
Mile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve ben in this land seven year,&rdquo; Bill announced
emphatically, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I make free to say I never heard tell
of the burg before.&nbsp; Hold on!&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s have some more
of that whisky.&nbsp; Your information&rsquo;s flabbergasted me, that
it has.&nbsp; Now just whereabouts is this Dawson-place you was a-mentionin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the big flat jest below the mouth of Klondike,&rdquo; ol&rsquo;
Jim answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;But where has you-all ben this summer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind where we-all&rsquo;s ben,&rdquo; was Kink Mitchell&rsquo;s
testy reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;We-all&rsquo;s ben where the skeeters is that
thick you&rsquo;ve got to throw a stick into the air so as to see the
sun and tell the time of day.&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t I right, Bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; said Bill.&nbsp; &ldquo;But speakin&rsquo;
of this Dawson-place how like did it happen to be, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ounce to the pan on a creek called Bonanza, an&rsquo; they
ain&rsquo;t got to bedrock yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who struck it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At mention of the discoverer&rsquo;s name the partners stared at
each other disgustedly.&nbsp; Then they winked with great solemnity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Siwash George,&rdquo; sniffed Hootchinoo Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That squaw-man,&rdquo; sneered Kink Mitchell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t put on my moccasins to stampede after anything
he&rsquo;d ever find,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; announced his partner.&nbsp; &ldquo;A cuss
that&rsquo;s too plumb lazy to fish his own salmon.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
why he took up with the Indians.&nbsp; S&rsquo;pose that black brother-in-law
of his,&mdash;lemme see, Skookum Jim, eh?&mdash;s&rsquo;pose he&rsquo;s
in on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old bar-keeper nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; what&rsquo;s
more, all Forty Mile, exceptin&rsquo; me an&rsquo; a few cripples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And drunks,&rdquo; added Kink Mitchell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-sir-ee!&rdquo; the old man shouted emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet you the drinks Honkins ain&rsquo;t in on it!&rdquo;
Hootchinoo Bill cried with certitude.</p>
<p>Ol&rsquo; Jim&rsquo;s face lighted up.&nbsp; &ldquo;I takes you,
Bill, an&rsquo; you loses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However did that ol&rsquo; soak budge out of Forty Mile?&rdquo;
Mitchell demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ties him down an&rsquo; throws him in the bottom of a
polin&rsquo;-boat,&rdquo; ol&rsquo; Jim explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come
right in here, they did, an&rsquo; takes him out of that there chair
there in the corner, an&rsquo; three more drunks they finds under the
pianny.&nbsp; I tell you-alls the whole camp hits up the Yukon for Dawson
jes&rsquo; like Sam Scratch was after them,&mdash;wimmen, children,
babes in arms, the whole shebang.&nbsp; Bidwell comes to me an&rsquo;
sez, sez he, &lsquo;Jim, I wants you to keep tab on the Monte Carlo.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Barlow?&rsquo; sez I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gone,&rsquo;
sez he, &lsquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m a-followin&rsquo; with a load of
whisky.&rsquo;&nbsp; An&rsquo; with that, never waitin&rsquo; for me
to decline, he makes a run for his boat an&rsquo; away he goes, polin&rsquo;
up river like mad.&nbsp; So here I be, an&rsquo; these is the first
drinks I&rsquo;ve passed out in three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The partners looked at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh darn my buttoms!&rdquo; said Hootchinoo Bill.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seems
likes you and me, Kink, is the kind of folks always caught out with
forks when it rains soup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it take the saleratus out your dough, now?&rdquo;
said Kink Mitchell.&nbsp; &ldquo;A stampede of tin-horns, drunks, an&rsquo;
loafers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; squaw-men,&rdquo; added Bill.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not a
genooine miner in the whole caboodle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Genooine miners like you an&rsquo; me, Kink,&rdquo; he went
on academically, &ldquo;is all out an&rsquo; sweatin&rsquo; hard over
Birch Creek way.&nbsp; Not a genooine miner in this whole crazy Dawson
outfit, and I say right here, not a step do I budge for any Carmack
strike.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got to see the colour of the dust first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; Mitchell agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
have another drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having wet this resolution, they beached the canoe, transferred its
contents to their cabin, and cooked dinner.&nbsp; But as the afternoon
wore along they grew restive.&nbsp; They were men used to the silence
of the great wilderness, but this gravelike silence of a town worried
them.&nbsp; They caught themselves listening for familiar sounds&mdash;&ldquo;waitin&rsquo;
for something to make a noise which ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to make
a noise,&rdquo; as Bill put it.&nbsp; They strolled through the deserted
streets to the Monte Carlo for more drinks, and wandered along the river
bank to the steamer landing, where only water gurgled as the eddy filled
and emptied, and an occasional salmon leapt flashing into the sun.</p>
<p>They sat down in the shade in front of the store and talked with
the consumptive storekeeper, whose liability to hemorrhage accounted
for his presence.&nbsp; Bill and Kink told him how they intended loafing
in their cabin and resting up after the hard summer&rsquo;s work.&nbsp;
They told him, with a certain insistence, that was half appeal for belief,
half challenge for contradiction, how much they were going to enjoy
their idleness.&nbsp; But the storekeeper was uninterested.&nbsp; He
switched the conversation back to the strike on Klondike, and they could
not keep him away from it.&nbsp; He could think of nothing else, talk
of nothing else, till Hootchinoo Bill rose up in anger and disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh darn Dawson, say I!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; said Kink Mitchell, with a brightening face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One&rsquo;d think something was doin&rsquo; up there, &rsquo;stead
of bein&rsquo; a mere stampede of greenhorns an&rsquo; tinhorns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But a boat came into view from down-stream.&nbsp; It was long and
slim.&nbsp; It hugged the bank closely, and its three occupants, standing
upright, propelled it against the stiff current by means of long poles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Circle City outfit,&rdquo; said the storekeeper.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
was lookin&rsquo; for &rsquo;em along by afternoon.&nbsp; Forty Mile
had the start of them by a hundred and seventy miles.&nbsp; But gee!
they ain&rsquo;t losin&rsquo; any time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just sit here quiet-like and watch &rsquo;em string
by,&rdquo; Bill said complacently.</p>
<p>As he spoke, another boat appeared in sight, followed after a brief
interval by two others.&nbsp; By this time the first boat was abreast
of the men on the bank.&nbsp; Its occupants did not cease poling while
greetings were exchanged, and, though its progress was slow, a half-hour
saw it out of sight up river.</p>
<p>Still they came from below, boat after boat, in endless procession.&nbsp;
The uneasiness of Bill and Kink increased.&nbsp; They stole speculative,
tentative glances at each other, and when their eyes met looked away
in embarrassment.&nbsp; Finally, however, their eyes met and neither
looked away.</p>
<p>Kink opened his mouth to speak, but words failed him and his mouth
remained open while he continued to gaze at his partner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I was thinken&rsquo;, Kink,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
<p>They grinned sheepishly at each other, and by tacit consent started
to walk away.&nbsp; Their pace quickened, and by the time they arrived
at their cabin they were on the run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t lose no time with all that multitude a-rushin&rsquo;
by,&rdquo; Kink spluttered, as he jabbed the sour-dough can into the
beanpot with one hand and with the other gathered in the frying-pan
and coffee-pot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should say not,&rdquo; gasped Bill, his head and shoulders
buried in a clothes-sack wherein were stored winter socks and underwear.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I say, Kink, don&rsquo;t forget the saleratus on the corner shelf
back of the stove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half-an-hour later they were launching the canoe and loading up,
while the storekeeper made jocular remarks about poor, weak mortals
and the contagiousness of &ldquo;stampedin&rsquo; fever.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But when Bill and Kink thrust their long poles to bottom and started
the canoe against the current, he called after them:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so-long and good luck!&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t forget
to blaze a stake or two for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They nodded their heads vigorously and felt sorry for the poor wretch
who remained perforce behind.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Kink and Bill were sweating hard.&nbsp; According to the revised
Northland Scripture, the stampede is to the swift, the blazing of stakes
to the strong, and the Crown in royalties, gathers to itself the fulness
thereof.&nbsp; Kink and Bill were both swift and strong.&nbsp; They
took the soggy trail at a long, swinging gait that broke the hearts
of a couple of tender-feet who tried to keep up with them.&nbsp; Behind,
strung out between them and Dawson (where the boats were discarded and
land travel began), was the vanguard of the Circle City outfit.&nbsp;
In the race from Forty Mile the partners had passed every boat, winning
from the leading boat by a length in the Dawson eddy, and leaving its
occupants sadly behind the moment their feet struck the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! couldn&rsquo;t see us for smoke,&rdquo; Hootchinoo Bill
chuckled, flirting the stinging sweat from his brow and glancing swiftly
back along the way they had come.</p>
<p>Three men emerged from where the trail broke through the trees.&nbsp;
Two followed close at their heels, and then a man and a woman shot into
view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, you Kink!&nbsp; Hit her up!&nbsp; Hit her up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill quickened his pace.&nbsp; Mitchell glanced back in more leisurely
fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare if they ain&rsquo;t lopin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s loped himself out,&rdquo;
said Bill, pointing to the side of the trail.</p>
<p>A man was lying on his back panting in the culminating stages of
violent exhaustion.&nbsp; His face was ghastly, his eyes bloodshot and
glazed, for all the world like a dying man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Chechaquo</i>!&rdquo; Kink Mitchell grunted, and it was
the grunt of the old &ldquo;sour dough&rdquo; for the green-horn, for
the man who outfitted with &ldquo;self-risin&rsquo;&rdquo; flour and
used baking-powder in his biscuits.</p>
<p>The partners, true to the old-timer custom, had intended to stake
down-stream from the strike, but when they saw claim 81 BELOW blazed
on a tree,&mdash;which meant fully eight miles below Discovery,&mdash;they
changed their minds.&nbsp; The eight miles were covered in less than
two hours.&nbsp; It was a killing pace, over so rough trail, and they
passed scores of exhausted men that had fallen by the wayside.</p>
<p>At Discovery little was to be learned of the upper creek.&nbsp; Cormack&rsquo;s
Indian brother-in-law, Skookum Jim, had a hazy notion that the creek
was staked as high as the 30&rsquo;s; but when Kink and Bill looked
at the corner-stakes of 79 ABOVE, they threw their stampeding packs
off their backs and sat down to smoke.&nbsp; All their efforts had been
vain.&nbsp; Bonanza was staked from mouth to source,&mdash;&ldquo;out
of sight and across the next divide.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bill complained that
night as they fried their bacon and boiled their coffee over Cormack&rsquo;s
fire at Discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try that pup,&rdquo; Carmack suggested next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That pup&rdquo; was a broad creek that flowed into Bonanza
at 7 ABOVE.&nbsp; The partners received his advice with the magnificent
contempt of the sour dough for a squaw-man, and, instead, spent the
day on Adam&rsquo;s Creek, another and more likely-looking tributary
of Bonanza.&nbsp; But it was the old story over again&mdash;staked to
the sky-line.</p>
<p>For threes days Carmack repeated his advice, and for three days they
received it contemptuously.&nbsp; But on the fourth day, there being
nowhere else to go, they went up &ldquo;that pup.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
knew that it was practically unstaked, but they had no intention of
staking.&nbsp; The trip was made more for the purpose of giving vent
to their ill-humour than for anything else.&nbsp; They had become quite
cynical, sceptical.&nbsp; They jeered and scoffed at everything, and
insulted every <i>chechaquo</i> they met along the way.</p>
<p>At No. 23 the stakes ceased.&nbsp; The remainder of the creek was
open for location.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moose pasture,&rdquo; sneered Kink Mitchell.</p>
<p>But Bill gravely paced off five hundred feet up the creek and blazed
the corner-stakes.&nbsp; He had picked up the bottom of a candle-box,
and on the smooth side he wrote the notice for his centre-stake:-</p>
<blockquote><p>THIS MOOSE PASTURE IS RESERVED FOR THE<br />
SWEDES AND CHECHAQUOS.<br />
&mdash;BILL RADER.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kink read it over with approval, saying:-</p>
<p>&ldquo;As them&rsquo;s my sentiments, I reckon I might as well subscribe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the name of Charles Mitchell was added to the notice; and many
an old sour dough&rsquo;s face relaxed that day at sight of the handiwork
of a kindred spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the pup?&rdquo; Carmack inquired when they strolled
back into camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To hell with pups!&rdquo; was Hootchinoo Bill&rsquo;s reply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Me and Kink&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; a-lookin&rsquo; for Too Much
Gold when we get rested up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Too Much Gold was the fabled creek of which all sour doughs dreamed,
whereof it was said the gold was so thick that, in order to wash it,
gravel must first be shovelled into the sluice-boxes.&nbsp; But the
several days&rsquo; rest, preliminary to the quest for Too Much Gold,
brought a slight change in their plan, inasmuch as it brought one Ans
Handerson, a Swede.</p>
<p>Ans Handerson had been working for wages all summer at Miller Creek
over on the Sixty Mile, and, the summer done, had strayed up Bonanza
like many another waif helplessly adrift on the gold tides that swept
willy-nilly across the land.&nbsp; He was tall and lanky.&nbsp; His
arms were long, like prehistoric man&rsquo;s, and his hands were like
soup-plates, twisted and gnarled, and big-knuckled from toil.&nbsp;
He was slow of utterance and movement, and his eyes, pale blue as his
hair was pale yellow, seemed filled with an immortal dreaming, the stuff
of which no man knew, and himself least of all.&nbsp; Perhaps this appearance
of immortal dreaming was due to a supreme and vacuous innocence.&nbsp;
At any rate, this was the valuation men of ordinary clay put upon him,
and there was nothing extraordinary about the composition of Hootchinoo
Bill and Kink Mitchell.</p>
<p>The partners had spent a day of visiting and gossip, and in the evening
met in the temporary quarters of the Monte Carlo&mdash;a large tent
were stampeders rested their weary bones and bad whisky sold at a dollar
a drink.&nbsp; Since the only money in circulation was dust, and since
the house took the &ldquo;down-weight&rdquo; on the scales, a drink
cost something more than a dollar.&nbsp; Bill and Kink were not drinking,
principally for the reason that their one and common sack was not strong
enough to stand many excursions to the scales.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Bill, I&rsquo;ve got a <i>chechaquo</i> on the string
for a sack of flour,&rdquo; Mitchell announced jubilantly.</p>
<p>Bill looked interested and pleased.&nbsp; Grub as scarce, and they
were not over-plentifully supplied for the quest after Too Much Gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flour&rsquo;s worth a dollar a pound,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How like do you calculate to get your finger on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trade &rsquo;m a half-interest in that claim of ourn,&rdquo;
Kink answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What claim?&rdquo; Bill was surprised.&nbsp; Then he remembered
the reservation he had staked off for the Swedes, and said, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be so clost about it, though,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Give &rsquo;m the whole thing while you&rsquo;re about it, in
a right free-handed way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I did, he&rsquo;d get clean
scairt and prance off.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m lettin&rsquo; on as how the ground
is believed to be valuable, an&rsquo; that we&rsquo;re lettin&rsquo;
go half just because we&rsquo;re monstrous short on grub.&nbsp; After
the dicker we can make him a present of the whole shebang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If somebody ain&rsquo;t disregarded our notice,&rdquo; Bill
objected, though he was plainly pleased at the prospect of exchanging
the claim for a sack of flour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t jumped,&rdquo; Kink assured him.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
No. 24, and it stands.&nbsp; The <i>chechaquos</i> took it serious,
and they begun stakin&rsquo; where you left off.&nbsp; Staked clean
over the divide, too.&nbsp; I was gassin&rsquo; with one of them which
has just got in with cramps in his legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then, and for the first time, that they heard the slow and
groping utterance of Ans Handerson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay like the looks,&rdquo; he was saying to the bar-keeper.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ay tank Ay gat a claim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The partners winked at each other, and a few minutes later a surprised
and grateful Swede was drinking bad whisky with two hard-hearted strangers.&nbsp;
But he was as hard-headed as they were hard-hearted.&nbsp; The sack
made frequent journeys to the scales, followed solicitously each time
by Kink Mitchell&rsquo;s eyes, and still Ans Handerson did not loosen
up.&nbsp; In his pale blue eyes, as in summer seas, immortal dreams
swam up and burned, but the swimming and the burning were due to the
tales of gold and prospect pans he heard, rather than to the whisky
he slid so easily down his throat.</p>
<p>The partners were in despair, though they appeared boisterous and
jovial of speech and action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me, my friend,&rdquo; Hootchinoo Bill hiccoughed,
his hand upon Ans Handerson&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have another
drink.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re just celebratin&rsquo; Kink&rsquo;s birthday
here.&nbsp; This is my pardner, Kink, Kink Mitchell.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
what might your name be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This learned, his hand descended resoundingly on Kink&rsquo;s back,
and Kink simulated clumsy self-consciousness in that he was for the
time being the centre of the rejoicing, while Ans Handerson looked pleased
and asked them to have a drink with him.&nbsp; It was the first and
last time he treated, until the play changed and his canny soul was
roused to unwonted prodigality.&nbsp; But he paid for the liquor from
a fairly healthy-looking sack.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not less &rsquo;n eight
hundred in it,&rdquo; calculated the lynx-eyed Kink; and on the strength
of it he took the first opportunity of a privy conversation with Bidwell,
proprietor of the bad whisky and the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my sack, Bidwell,&rdquo; Kink said, with the
intimacy and surety of one old-timer to another.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just weigh
fifty dollars into it for a day or so more or less, and we&rsquo;ll
be yours truly, Bill an&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereafter the journeys of the sack to the scales were more frequent,
and the celebration of Kink&rsquo;s natal day waxed hilarious.&nbsp;
He even essayed to sing the old-timer&rsquo;s classic, &ldquo;The Juice
of the Forbidden Fruit,&rdquo; but broke down and drowned his embarrassment
in another round of drinks.&nbsp; Even Bidwell honoured him with a round
or two on the house; and he and Bill were decently drunk by the time
Ans Handerson&rsquo;s eyelids began to droop and his tongue gave promise
of loosening.</p>
<p>Bill grew affectionate, then confidential.&nbsp; He told his troubles
and hard luck to the bar-keeper and the world in general, and to Ans
Handerson in particular.&nbsp; He required no histrionic powers to act
the part.&nbsp; The bad whisky attended to that.&nbsp; He worked himself
into a great sorrow for himself and Bill, and his tears were sincere
when he told how he and his partner were thinking of selling a half-interest
in good ground just because they were short of grub.&nbsp; Even Kink
listened and believed.</p>
<p>Ans Handerson&rsquo;s eyes were shining unholily as he asked, &ldquo;How
much you tank you take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill and Kink did not hear him, and he was compelled to repeat his
query.&nbsp; They appeared reluctant.&nbsp; He grew keener.&nbsp; And
he swayed back and forward, holding on to the bar and listened with
all his ears while they conferred together on one side, and wrangled
as to whether they should or not, and disagreed in stage whispers over
the price they should set.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred and&mdash;hic!&mdash;fifty,&rdquo; Bill finally
announced, &ldquo;but we reckon as we won&rsquo;t sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is monstrous wise if I might chip in my little say,&rdquo;
seconded Bidwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeedy,&rdquo; added Kink.&nbsp; &ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t
in no charity business a-disgorgin&rsquo; free an&rsquo; generous to
Swedes an&rsquo; white men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay tank we haf another drink,&rdquo; hiccoughed Ans Handerson,
craftily changing the subject against a more propitious time.</p>
<p>And thereafter, to bring about that propitious time, his own sack
began to see-saw between his hip pocket and the scales.&nbsp; Bill and
Kink were coy, but they finally yielded to his blandishments.&nbsp;
Whereupon he grew shy and drew Bidwell to one side.&nbsp; He staggered
exceedingly, and held on to Bidwell for support as he asked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ban all right, them men, you tank so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Bidwell answered heartily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Known
&rsquo;em for years.&nbsp; Old sour doughs.&nbsp; When they sell a claim,
they sell a claim.&nbsp; They ain&rsquo;t no air-dealers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay tank Ay buy,&rdquo; Ans Handerson announced, tottering
back to the two men.</p>
<p>But by now he was dreaming deeply, and he proclaimed he would have
the whole claim or nothing.&nbsp; This was the cause of great pain to
Hootchinoo Bill.&nbsp; He orated grandly against the &ldquo;hawgishness&rdquo;
of <i>chechaquos</i> and Swedes, albeit he dozed between periods, his
voice dying away to a gurgle, and his head sinking forward on his breast.&nbsp;
But whenever roused by a nudge from Kink or Bidwell, he never failed
to explode another volley of abuse and insult.</p>
<p>Ans Handerson was calm under it all.&nbsp; Each insult added to the
value of the claim.&nbsp; Such unamiable reluctance to sell advertised
but one thing to him, and he was aware of a great relief when Hootchinoo
Bill sank snoring to the floor, and he was free to turn his attention
to his less intractable partner.</p>
<p>Kink Mitchell was persuadable, though a poor mathematician.&nbsp;
He wept dolefully, but was willing to sell a half-interest for two hundred
and fifty dollars or the whole claim for seven hundred and fifty.&nbsp;
Ans Handerson and Bidwell laboured to clear away his erroneous ideas
concerning fractions, but their labour was vain.&nbsp; He spilled tears
and regrets all over the bar and on their shoulders, which tears, however,
did not wash away his opinion, that if one half was worth two hundred
and fifty, two halves were worth three times as much.</p>
<p>In the end,&mdash;and even Bidwell retained no more than hazy recollections
of how the night terminated,&mdash;a bill of sale was drawn up, wherein
Bill Rader and Charles Mitchell yielded up all right and title to the
claim known as 24 ELDORADO, the same being the name the creek had received
from some optimistic <i>chechaquo</i>.</p>
<p>When Kink had signed, it took the united efforts of the three to
arouse Bill.&nbsp; Pen in hand, he swayed long over the document; and,
each time he rocked back and forth, in Ans Handerson&rsquo;s eyes flashed
and faded a wondrous golden vision.&nbsp; When the precious signature
was at last appended and the dust paid over, he breathed a great sigh,
and sank to sleep under a table, where he dreamed immortally until morning.</p>
<p>But the day was chill and grey.&nbsp; He felt bad.&nbsp; His first
act, unconscious and automatic, was to feel for his sack.&nbsp; Its
lightness startled him.&nbsp; Then, slowly, memories of the night thronged
into his brain.&nbsp; Rough voices disturbed him.&nbsp; He opened his
eyes and peered out from under the table.&nbsp; A couple of early risers,
or, rather, men who had been out on trail all night, were vociferating
their opinions concerning the utter and loathsome worthlessness of Eldorado
Creek.&nbsp; He grew frightened, felt in his pocket, and found the deed
to 24 ELDORADO.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Hootchinoo Bill and Kink Mitchell were roused from
their blankets by a wild-eyed Swede that strove to force upon them an
ink-scrawled and very blotty piece of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay tank Ay take my money back,&rdquo; he gibbered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay
tank Ay take my money back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears were in his eyes and throat.&nbsp; They ran down his cheeks
as he knelt before them and pleaded and implored.&nbsp; But Bill and
Kink did not laugh.&nbsp; They might have been harder hearted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First time I ever hear a man squeal over a minin&rsquo; deal,&rdquo;
Bill said.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; I make free to say &rsquo;tis too
onusual for me to savvy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; Kink Mitchell remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Minin&rsquo;
deals is like horse-tradin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were honest in their wonderment.&nbsp; They could not conceive
of themselves raising a wail over a business transaction, so they could
not understand it in another man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor, ornery <i>chechaquo</i>,&rdquo; murmured Hootchinoo
Bill, as they watched the sorrowing Swede disappear up the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this ain&rsquo;t Too Much Gold,&rdquo; Kink Mitchell said
cheerfully.</p>
<p>And ere the day was out they purchased flour and bacon at exorbitant
prices with Ans Handerson&rsquo;s dust and crossed over the divide in
the direction of the creeks that lie between Klondike and Indian River.</p>
<p>Three months later they came back over the divide in the midst of
a snow-storm and dropped down the trail to 24 ELDORADO.&nbsp; It merely
chanced that the trail led them that way.&nbsp; They were not looking
for the claim.&nbsp; Nor could they see much through the driving white
till they set foot upon the claim itself.&nbsp; And then the air lightened,
and they beheld a dump, capped by a windlass that a man was turning.&nbsp;
They saw him draw a bucket of gravel from the hole and tilt it on the
edge of the dump.&nbsp; Likewise they saw another, man, strangely familiar,
filling a pan with the fresh gravel.&nbsp; His hands were large; his
hair wets pale yellow.&nbsp; But before they reached him, he turned
with the pan and fled toward a cabin.&nbsp; He wore no hat, and the
snow falling down his neck accounted for his haste.&nbsp; Bill and Kink
ran after him, and came upon him in the cabin, kneeling by the stove
and washing the pan of gravel in a tub of water.</p>
<p>He was too deeply engaged to notice more than that somebody had entered
the cabin.&nbsp; They stood at his shoulder and looked on.&nbsp; He
imparted to the pan a deft circular motion, pausing once or twice to
rake out the larger particles of gravel with his fingers.&nbsp; The
water was muddy, and, with the pan buried in it, they could see nothing
of its contents.&nbsp; Suddenly he lifted the pan clear and sent the
water out of it with a flirt.&nbsp; A mass of yellow, like butter in
a churn, showed across the bottom.</p>
<p>Hootchinoo Bill swallowed.&nbsp; Never in his life had he dreamed
of so rich a test-pan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of thick, my friend,&rdquo; he said huskily.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
much might you reckon that-all to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ans Handerson did not look up as he replied, &ldquo;Ay tank fafty
ounces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be scrumptious rich, then, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still Ans Handerson kept his head down, absorbed in putting in the
fine touches which wash out the last particles of dross, though he answered,
&ldquo;Ay tank Ay ban wort&rsquo; five hundred t&rsquo;ousand dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; said Hootchinoo Bill, and he said it reverently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Bill, gosh!&rdquo; said Kink Mitchell; and they went
out softly and closed the door.</p>
<h2>THE ONE THOUSAND DOZEN</h2>
<p>David Rasmunsen was a hustler, and, like many a greater man, a man
of the one idea.&nbsp; Wherefore, when the clarion call of the North
rang on his ear, he conceived an adventure in eggs and bent all his
energy to its achievement.&nbsp; He figured briefly and to the point,
and the adventure became iridescent-hued, splendid.&nbsp; That eggs
would sell at Dawson for five dollars a dozen was a safe working premise.&nbsp;
Whence it was incontrovertible that one thousand dozen would bring,
in the Golden Metropolis, five thousand dollars.</p>
<p>On the other hand, expense was to be considered, and he considered
it well, for he was a careful man, keenly practical, with a hard head
and a heart that imagination never warmed.&nbsp; At fifteen cents a
dozen, the initial cost of his thousand dozen would be one hundred and
fifty dollars, a mere bagatelle in face of the enormous profit.&nbsp;
And suppose, just suppose, to be wildly extravagant for once, that transportation
for himself and eggs should run up eight hundred and fifty more; he
would still have four thousand clear cash and clean when the last egg
was disposed of and the last dust had rippled into his sack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Alma,&rdquo;&mdash;he figured it over with his wife,
the cosy dining-room submerged in a sea of maps, government surveys,
guide-books, and Alaskan itineraries,&mdash;&ldquo;you see, expenses
don&rsquo;t really begin till you make Dyea&mdash;fifty dollars&rsquo;ll
cover it with a first-class passage thrown in.&nbsp; Now from Dyea to
Lake Linderman, Indian packers take your goods over for twelve cents
a pound, twelve dollars a hundred, or one hundred and twenty dollars
a thousand.&nbsp; Say I have fifteen hundred pounds, it&rsquo;ll cost
one hundred and eighty dollars&mdash;call it two hundred and be safe.&nbsp;
I am creditably informed by a Klondiker just come out that I can buy
a boat for three hundred.&nbsp; But the same man says I&rsquo;m sure
to get a couple of passengers for one hundred and fifty each, which
will give me the boat for nothing, and, further, they can help me manage
it.&nbsp; And . . . that&rsquo;s all; I put my eggs ashore from the
boat at Dawson.&nbsp; Now let me see how much is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty dollars from San Francisco to Dyea, two hundred from
Dyea to Linderman, passengers pay for the boat&mdash;two hundred and
fifty all told,&rdquo; she summed up swiftly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a hundred for my clothes and personal outfit,&rdquo; he
went on happily; &ldquo;that leaves a margin of five hundred for emergencies.&nbsp;
And what possible emergencies can arise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alma shrugged her shoulders and elevated her brows.&nbsp; If that
vast Northland was capable of swallowing up a man and a thousand dozen
eggs, surely there was room and to spare for whatever else he might
happen to possess.&nbsp; So she thought, but she said nothing.&nbsp;
She knew David Rasmunsen too well to say anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubling the time because of chance delays, I should make
the trip in two months.&nbsp; Think of it, Alma!&nbsp; Four thousand
in two months!&nbsp; Beats the paltry hundred a month I&rsquo;m getting
now.&nbsp; Why, we&rsquo;ll build further out where we&rsquo;ll have
more space, gas in every room, and a view, and the rent of the cottage&rsquo;ll
pay taxes, insurance, and water, and leave something over.&nbsp; And
then there&rsquo;s always the chance of my striking it and coming out
a millionaire.&nbsp; Now tell me, Alma, don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;m
very moderate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Alma could hardly think otherwise.&nbsp; Besides, had not her
own cousin,&mdash;though a remote and distant one to be sure, the black
sheep, the harum-scarum, the ne&rsquo;er-do-well,&mdash;had not he come
down out of that weird North country with a hundred thousand in yellow
dust, to say nothing of a half-ownership in the hole from which it came?</p>
<p>David Rasmunsen&rsquo;s grocer was surprised when he found him weighing
eggs in the scales at the end of the counter, and Rasmunsen himself
was more surprised when he found that a dozen eggs weighed a pound and
a half&mdash;fifteen hundred pounds for his thousand dozen!&nbsp; There
would be no weight left for his clothes, blankets, and cooking utensils,
to say nothing of the grub he must necessarily consume by the way.&nbsp;
His calculations were all thrown out, and he was just proceeding to
recast them when he hit upon the idea of weighing small eggs.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For whether they be large or small, a dozen eggs is a dozen eggs,&rdquo;
he observed sagely to himself; and a dozen small ones he found to weigh
but a pound and a quarter.&nbsp; Thereat the city of San Francisco was
overrun by anxious-eyed emissaries, and commission houses and dairy
associations were startled by a sudden demand for eggs running not more
than twenty ounces to the dozen.</p>
<p>Rasmunsen mortgaged the little cottage for a thousand dollars, arranged
for his wife to make a prolonged stay among her own people, threw up
his job, and started North.&nbsp; To keep within his schedule he compromised
on a second-class passage, which, because of the rush, was worse than
steerage; and in the late summer, a pale and wabbly man, he disembarked
with his eggs on the Dyea beach.&nbsp; But it did not take him long
to recover his land legs and appetite.&nbsp; His first interview with
the Chilkoot packers straightened him up and stiffened his backbone.&nbsp;
Forty cents a pound they demanded for the twenty-eight-mile portage,
and while he caught his breath and swallowed, the price went up to forty-three.&nbsp;
Fifteen husky Indians put the straps on his packs at forty-five, but
took them off at an offer of forty-seven from a Skaguay Croesus in dirty
shirt and ragged overalls who had lost his horses on the White Pass
trail and was now making a last desperate drive at the country by way
of Chilkoot.</p>
<p>But Rasmunsen was clean grit, and at fifty cents found takers, who,
two days later, set his eggs down intact at Linderman.&nbsp; But fifty
cents a pound is a thousand dollars a ton, and his fifteen hundred pounds
had exhausted his emergency fund and left him stranded at the Tantalus
point where each day he saw the fresh-whipsawed boats departing for
Dawson.&nbsp; Further, a great anxiety brooded over the camp where the
boats were built.&nbsp; Men worked frantically, early and late, at the
height of their endurance, caulking, nailing, and pitching in a frenzy
of haste for which adequate explanation was not far to seek.&nbsp; Each
day the snow-line crept farther down the bleak, rock-shouldered peaks,
and gale followed gale, with sleet and slush and snow, and in the eddies
and quiet places young ice formed and thickened through the fleeting
hours.&nbsp; And each morn, toil-stiffened men turned wan faces across
the lake to see if the freeze-up had come.&nbsp; For the freeze-up heralded
the death of their hope&mdash;the hope that they would be floating down
the swift river ere navigation closed on the chain of lakes.</p>
<p>To harrow Rasmunsen&rsquo;s soul further, he discovered three competitors
in the egg business.&nbsp; It was true that one, a little German, had
gone broke and was himself forlornly back-tripping the last pack of
the portage; but the other two had boats nearly completed, and were
daily supplicating the god of merchants and traders to stay the iron
hand of winter for just another day.&nbsp; But the iron hand closed
down over the land.&nbsp; Men were being frozen in the blizzard which
swept Chilkoot, and Rasmunsen frosted his toes ere he was aware.&nbsp;
He found a chance to go passenger with his freight in a boat just shoving
off through the rubble, but two hundred hard cash, was required, and
he had no money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay tank you yust wait one leedle w&rsquo;ile,&rdquo; said
the Swedish boat-builder, who had struck his Klondike right there and
was wise enough to know it&mdash;&ldquo;one leedle w&rsquo;ile und I
make you a tam fine skiff boat, sure Pete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this unpledged word to go on, Rasmunsen hit the back trail to
Crater Lake, where he fell in with two press correspondents whose tangled
baggage was strewn from Stone House, over across the Pass, and as far
as Happy Camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said with consequence.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
a thousand dozen eggs at Linderman, and my boat&rsquo;s just about got
the last seam caulked.&nbsp; Consider myself in luck to get it.&nbsp;
Boats are at a premium, you know, and none to be had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon and almost with bodily violence the correspondents clamoured
to go with him, fluttered greenbacks before his eyes, and spilled yellow
twenties from hand to hand.&nbsp; He could not hear of it, but they
over-persuaded him, and he reluctantly consented to take them at three
hundred apiece.&nbsp; Also they pressed upon him the passage money in
advance.&nbsp; And while they wrote to their respective journals concerning
the Good Samaritan with the thousand dozen eggs, the Good Samaritan
was hurrying back to the Swede at Linderman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you!&nbsp; Gimme that boat!&rdquo; was his salutation,
his hand jingling the correspondents&rsquo; gold pieces and his eyes
hungrily bent upon the finished craft.</p>
<p>The Swede regarded him stolidly and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much is the other fellow paying?&nbsp; Three hundred?&nbsp;
Well, here&rsquo;s four.&nbsp; Take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried to press it upon him, but the man backed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay tank not.&nbsp; Ay say him get der skiff boat.&nbsp; You
yust wait&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s six hundred.&nbsp; Last call.&nbsp; Take it or
leave it.&nbsp; Tell &rsquo;m it&rsquo;s a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Swede wavered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay tank yes,&rdquo; he finally said,
and the last Rasmunsen saw of him his vocabulary was going to wreck
in a vain effort to explain the mistake to the other fellows.</p>
<p>The German slipped and broke his ankle on the steep hogback above
Deep Lake, sold out his stock for a dollar a dozen, and with the proceeds
hired Indian packers to carry him back to Dyea.&nbsp; But on the morning
Rasmunsen shoved off with his correspondents, his two rivals followed
suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many you got?&rdquo; one of them, a lean little New Englander,
called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thousand dozen,&rdquo; Rasmunsen answered proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go you even stakes I beat you in with
my eight hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The correspondents offered to lend him the money; but Rasmunsen declined,
and the Yankee closed with the remaining rival, a brawny son of the
sea and sailor of ships and things, who promised to show them all a
wrinkle or two when it came to cracking on.&nbsp; And crack on he did,
with a large tarpaulin square-sail which pressed the bow half under
at every jump.&nbsp; He was the first to run out of Linderman, but,
disdaining the portage, piled his loaded boat on the rocks in the boiling
rapids.&nbsp; Rasmunsen and the Yankee, who likewise had two passengers,
portaged across on their backs and then lined their empty boats down
through the bad water to Bennett.</p>
<p>Bennett was a twenty-five-mile lake, narrow and deep, a funnel between
the mountains through which storms ever romped.&nbsp; Rasmunsen camped
on the sand-pit at its head, where were many men and boats bound north
in the teeth of the Arctic winter.&nbsp; He awoke in the morning to
find a piping gale from the south, which caught the chill from the whited
peaks and glacial valleys and blew as cold as north wind ever blew.&nbsp;
But it was fair, and he also found the Yankee staggering past the first
bold headland with all sail set.&nbsp; Boat after boat was getting under
way, and the correspondents fell to with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll catch him before Cariboo Crossing,&rdquo; they
assured Rasmunsen, as they ran up the sail and the Alma took the first
icy spray over her bow.</p>
<p>Now Rasmunsen all his life had been prone to cowardice on water,
but he clung to the kicking steering-oar with set face and determined
jaw.&nbsp; His thousand dozen were there in the boat before his eyes,
safely secured beneath the correspondents&rsquo; baggage, and somehow,
before his eyes were the little cottage and the mortgage for a thousand
dollars.</p>
<p>It was bitter cold.&nbsp; Now and again he hauled in the steering-sweep
and put out a fresh one while his passengers chopped the ice from the
blade.&nbsp; Wherever the spray struck, it turned instantly to frost,
and the dipping boom of the spritsail was quickly fringed with icicles.&nbsp;
The <i>Alma</i> strained and hammered through the big seas till the
seams and butts began to spread, but in lieu of bailing the correspondents
chopped ice and flung it overboard.&nbsp; There was no let-up.&nbsp;
The mad race with winter was on, and the boats tore along in a desperate
string.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-w-we can&rsquo;t stop to save our souls!&rdquo; one of the
correspondents chattered, from cold, not fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&nbsp; Keep her down the middle, old man!&rdquo;
the other encouraged.</p>
<p>Rasmunsen replied with an idiotic grin.&nbsp; The iron-bound shores
were in a lather of foam, and even down the middle the only hope was
to keep running away from the big seas.&nbsp; To lower sail was to be
overtaken and swamped.&nbsp; Time and again they passed boats pounding
among the rocks, and once they saw one on the edge of the breakers about
to strike.&nbsp; A little craft behind them, with two men, jibed over
and turned bottom up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-w-watch out, old man,&rdquo; cried he of the chattering
teeth.</p>
<p>Rasmunsen grinned and tightened his aching grip on the sweep.&nbsp;
Scores of times had the send of the sea caught the big square stern
of the <i>Alma</i> and thrown her off from dead before it till the after
leach of the spritsail fluttered hollowly, and each time, and only with
all his strength, had he forced her back.&nbsp; His grin by then had
become fixed, and it disturbed the correspondents to look at him.</p>
<p>They roared down past an isolated rock a hundred yards from shore.&nbsp;
From its wave-drenched top a man shrieked wildly, for the instant cutting
the storm with his voice.&nbsp; But the next instant the <i>Alma</i>
was by, and the rock growing a black speck in the troubled froth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles the Yankee!&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the sailor?&rdquo;
shouted one of his passengers.</p>
<p>Rasmunsen shot a glance over his shoulder at a black square-sail.&nbsp;
He had seen it leap up out of the grey to windward, and for an hour,
off and on, had been watching it grow.&nbsp; The sailor had evidently
repaired damages and was making up for lost time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at him come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both passengers stopped chopping ice to watch.&nbsp; Twenty miles
of Bennett were behind them&mdash;room and to spare for the sea to toss
up its mountains toward the sky.&nbsp; Sinking and soaring like a storm-god,
the sailor drove by them.&nbsp; The huge sail seemed to grip the boat
from the crests of the waves, to tear it bodily out of the water, and
fling it crashing and smothering down into the yawning troughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sea&rsquo;ll never catch him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll r-r-run her nose under!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as they spoke, the black tarpaulin swooped from sight behind
a big comber.&nbsp; The next wave rolled over the spot, and the next,
but the boat did not reappear.&nbsp; The <i>Alma</i> rushed by the place.&nbsp;
A little riffraff of oats and boxes was seen.&nbsp; An arm thrust up
and a shaggy head broke surface a score of yards away.</p>
<p>For a time there was silence.&nbsp; As the end of the lake came in
sight, the waves began to leap aboard with such steady recurrence that
the correspondents no longer chopped ice but flung the water out with
buckets.&nbsp; Even this would not do, and, after a shouted conference
with Rasmunsen, they attacked the baggage.&nbsp; Flour, bacon, beans,
blankets, cooking-stove, ropes, odds and ends, everything they could
get hands on, flew overboard.&nbsp; The boat acknowledged it at once,
taking less water and rising more buoyantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; Rasmunsen called sternly, as they
applied themselves to the top layer of eggs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The h-hell it will!&rdquo; answered the shivering one, savagely.&nbsp;
With the exception of their notes, films, and cameras, they had sacrificed
their outfit.&nbsp; He bent over, laid hold of an egg-box, and began
to worry it out from under the lashing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop it!&nbsp; Drop it, I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rasmunsen had managed to draw his revolver, and with the crook of
his arm over the sweep head, was taking aim.&nbsp; The correspondent
stood up on the thwart, balancing back and forth, his face twisted with
menace and speechless anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So cried his brother correspondent, hurling himself, face downward,
into the bottom of the boat.&nbsp; The <i>Alma</i>, under the divided
attention of Rasmunsen, had been caught by a great mass of water and
whirled around.&nbsp; The after leach hollowed, the sail emptied and
jibed, and the boom, sweeping with terrific force across the boat, carried
the angry correspondent overboard with a broken back.&nbsp; Mast and
sail had gone over the side as well.&nbsp; A drenching sea followed,
as the boat lost headway, and Rasmunsen sprang to the bailing bucket.</p>
<p>Several boats hurtled past them in the next half-hour,&mdash;small
boats, boats of their own size, boats afraid, unable to do aught but
run madly on.&nbsp; Then a ten-ton barge, at imminent risk of destruction,
lowered sail to windward and lumbered down upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep off!&nbsp; Keep off!&rdquo; Rasmunsen screamed.</p>
<p>But his low gunwale ground against the heavy craft, and the remaining
correspondent clambered aboard.&nbsp; Rasmunsen was over the eggs like
a cat and in the bow of the <i>Alma</i>, striving with numb fingers
to bend the hauling-lines together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; a red-whiskered man yelled at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a thousand dozen eggs here,&rdquo; he shouted back.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gimme a tow!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll pay you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; they howled in chorus.</p>
<p>A big whitecap broke just beyond, washing over the barge and leaving
the <i>Alma</i> half swamped.&nbsp; The men cast off, cursing him as
they ran up their sail.&nbsp; Rasmunsen cursed back and fell to bailing.&nbsp;
The mast and sail, like a sea anchor, still fast by the halyards, held
the boat head on to wind and sea and gave him a chance to fight the
water out.</p>
<p>Three hours later, numbed, exhausted, blathering like a lunatic,
but still bailing, he went ashore on an ice-strewn beach near Cariboo
Crossing.&nbsp; Two men, a government courier and a half-breed voyageur,
dragged him out of the surf, saved his cargo, and beached the Alma.&nbsp;
They were paddling out of the country in a Peterborough, and gave him
shelter for the night in their storm-bound camp.&nbsp; Next morning
they departed, but he elected to stay by his eggs.&nbsp; And thereafter
the name and fame of the man with the thousand dozen eggs began to spread
through the land.&nbsp; Gold-seekers who made in before the freeze-up
carried the news of his coming.&nbsp; Grizzled old-timers of Forty Mile
and Circle City, sour doughs with leathern jaws and bean-calloused stomachs,
called up dream memories of chickens and green things at mention of
his name.&nbsp; Dyea and Skaguay took an interest in his being, and
questioned his progress from every man who came over the passes, while
Dawson&mdash;golden, omeletless Dawson&mdash;fretted and worried, and
way-laid every chance arrival for word of him.</p>
<p>But of this Rasmunsen knew nothing.&nbsp; The day after the wreck
he patched up the <i>Alma</i> and pulled out.&nbsp; A cruel east wind
blew in his teeth from Tagish, but he got the oars over the side and
bucked manfully into it, though half the time he was drifting backward
and chopping ice from the blades.&nbsp; According to the custom of the
country, he was driven ashore at Windy Arm; three times on Tagish saw
him swamped and beached; and Lake Marsh held him at the freeze-up.&nbsp;
The <i>Alma</i> was crushed in the jamming of the floes, but the eggs
were intact.&nbsp; These he back-tripped two miles across the ice to
the shore, where he built a cache, which stood for years after and was
pointed out by men who knew.</p>
<p>Half a thousand frozen miles stretched between him and Dawson, and
the waterway was closed.&nbsp; But Rasmunsen, with a peculiar tense
look in his face, struck back up the lakes on foot.&nbsp; What he suffered
on that lone trip, with nought but a single blanket, an axe, and a handful
of beans, is not given to ordinary mortals to know.&nbsp; Only the Arctic
adventurer may understand.&nbsp; Suffice that he was caught in a blizzard
on Chilkoot and left two of his toes with the surgeon at Sheep Camp.&nbsp;
Yet he stood on his feet and washed dishes in the scullery of the <i>Pawona</i>
to the Puget Sound, and from there passed coal on a P. S. boat to San
Francisco.</p>
<p>It was a haggard, unkempt man who limped across the shining office
floor to raise a second mortgage from the bank people.&nbsp; His hollow
cheeks betrayed themselves through the scraggy beard, and his eyes seemed
to have retired into deep caverns where they burned with cold fires.&nbsp;
His hands were grained from exposure and hard work, and the nails were
rimmed with tight-packed dirt and coal-dust.&nbsp; He spoke vaguely
of eggs and ice-packs, winds and tides; but when they declined to let
him have more than a second thousand, his talk became incoherent, concerning
itself chiefly with the price of dogs and dog-food, and such things
as snowshoes and moccasins and winter trails.&nbsp; They let him have
fifteen hundred, which was more than the cottage warranted, and breathed
easier when he scrawled his signature and passed out the door.</p>
<p>Two weeks later he went over Chilkoot with three dog sleds of five
dogs each.&nbsp; One team he drove, the two Indians with him driving
the others.&nbsp; At Lake Marsh they broke out the cache and loaded
up.&nbsp; But there was no trail.&nbsp; He was the first in over the
ice, and to him fell the task of packing the snow and hammering away
through the rough river jams.&nbsp; Behind him he often observed a camp-fire
smoke trickling thinly up through the quiet air, and he wondered why
the people did not overtake him.&nbsp; For he was a stranger to the
land and did not understand.&nbsp; Nor could he understand his Indians
when they tried to explain.&nbsp; This they conceived to be a hardship,
but when they balked and refused to break camp of mornings, he drove
them to their work at pistol point.</p>
<p>When he slipped through an ice bridge near the White Horse and froze
his foot, tender yet and oversensitive from the previous freezing, the
Indians looked for him to lie up.&nbsp; But he sacrificed a blanket,
and, with his foot incased in an enormous moccasin, big as a water-bucket,
continued to take his regular turn with the front sled.&nbsp; Here was
the cruellest work, and they respected him, though on the side they
rapped their foreheads with their knuckles and significantly shook their
heads.&nbsp; One night they tried to run away, but the zip-zip of his
bullets in the snow brought them back, snarling but convinced.&nbsp;
Whereupon, being only savage Chilkat men, they put their heads together
to kill him; but he slept like a cat, and, waking or sleeping, the chance
never came.&nbsp; Often they tried to tell him the import of the smoke
wreath in the rear, but he could not comprehend and grew suspicious
of them.&nbsp; And when they sulked or shirked, he was quick to let
drive at them between the eyes, and quick to cool their heated souls
with sight of his ready revolver.</p>
<p>And so it went&mdash;with mutinous men, wild dogs, and a trail that
broke the heart.&nbsp; He fought the men to stay with him, fought the
dogs to keep them away from the eggs, fought the ice, the cold, and
the pain of his foot, which would not heal.&nbsp; As fast as the young
tissue renewed, it was bitten and scared by the frost, so that a running
sore developed, into which he could almost shove his fist.&nbsp; In
the mornings, when he first put his weight upon it, his head went dizzy,
and he was near to fainting from the pain; but later on in the day it
usually grew numb, to recommence when he crawled into his blankets and
tried to sleep.&nbsp; Yet he, who had been a clerk and sat at a desk
all his days, toiled till the Indians were exhausted, and even out-worked
the dogs.&nbsp; How hard he worked, how much he suffered, he did not
know.&nbsp; Being a man of the one idea, now that the idea had come,
it mastered him.&nbsp; In the foreground of his consciousness was Dawson,
in the background his thousand dozen eggs, and midway between the two
his ego fluttered, striving always to draw them together to a glittering
golden point.&nbsp; This golden point was the five thousand dollars,
the consummation of the idea and the point of departure for whatever
new idea might present itself.&nbsp; For the rest, he was a mere automaton.&nbsp;
He was unaware of other things, seeing them as through a glass darkly,
and giving them no thought.&nbsp; The work of his hands he did with
machine-like wisdom; likewise the work of his head.&nbsp; So the look
on his face grew very tense, till even the Indians were afraid of it,
and marvelled at the strange white man who had made them slaves and
forced them to toil with such foolishness.</p>
<p>Then came a snap on Lake Le Barge, when the cold of outer space smote
the tip of the planet, and the force ranged sixty and odd degrees below
zero.&nbsp; Here, labouring with open mouth that he might breathe more
freely, he chilled his lungs, and for the rest of the trip he was troubled
with a dry, hacking cough, especially irritable in smoke of camp or
under stress of undue exertion.&nbsp; On the Thirty Mile river he found
much open water, spanned by precarious ice bridges and fringed with
narrow rim ice, tricky and uncertain.&nbsp; The rim ice was impossible
to reckon on, and he dared it without reckoning, falling back on his
revolver when his drivers demurred.&nbsp; But on the ice bridges, covered
with snow though they were, precautions could be taken.&nbsp; These
they crossed on their snowshoes, with long poles, held crosswise in
their hands, to which to cling in case of accident.&nbsp; Once over,
the dogs were called to follow.&nbsp; And on such a bridge, where the
absence of the centre ice was masked by the snow, one of the Indians
met his end.&nbsp; He went through as quickly and neatly as a knife
through thin cream, and the current swept him from view down under the
stream ice.</p>
<p>That night his mate fled away through the pale moonlight, Rasmunsen
futilely puncturing the silence with his revolver&mdash;a thing that
he handled with more celerity than cleverness.&nbsp; Thirty-six hours
later the Indian made a police camp on the Big Salmon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um&mdash;um&mdash;um funny mans&mdash;what you call?&mdash;top
um head all loose,&rdquo; the interpreter explained to the puzzled captain.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Eh?&nbsp; Yep, clazy, much clazy mans.&nbsp; Eggs, eggs, all
a time eggs&mdash;savvy?&nbsp; Come bime-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was several days before Rasmunsen arrived, the three sleds lashed
together, and all the dogs in a single team.&nbsp; It was awkward, and
where the going was bad he was compelled to back-trip it sled by sled,
though he managed most of the time, through herculean efforts, to bring
all along on the one haul.&nbsp; He did not seem moved when the captain
of police told him his man was hitting the high places for Dawson, and
was by that time, probably, half-way between Selkirk and Stewart.&nbsp;
Nor did he appear interested when informed that the police had broken
the trail as far as Pelly; for he had attained to a fatalistic acceptance
of all natural dispensations, good or ill.&nbsp; But when they told
him that Dawson was in the bitter clutch of famine, he smiled, threw
the harness on his dogs, and pulled out.</p>
<p>But it was at his next halt that the mystery of the smoke was explained.&nbsp;
With the word at Big Salmon that the trail was broken to Pelly, there
was no longer any need for the smoke wreath to linger in his wake; and
Rasmunsen, crouching over lonely fire, saw a motley string of sleds
go by.&nbsp; First came the courier and the half-breed who had hauled
him out from Bennett; then mail-carriers for Circle City, two sleds
of them, and a mixed following of ingoing Klondikers.&nbsp; Dogs and
men were fresh and fat, while Rasmunsen and his brutes were jaded and
worn down to the skin and bone.&nbsp; They of the smoke wreath had travelled
one day in three, resting and reserving their strength for the dash
to come when broken trail was met with; while each day he had plunged
and floundered forward, breaking the spirit of his dogs and robbing
them of their mettle.</p>
<p>As for himself, he was unbreakable.&nbsp; They thanked him kindly
for his efforts in their behalf, those fat, fresh men,&mdash;thanked
him kindly, with broad grins and ribald laughter; and now, when he understood,
he made no answer.&nbsp; Nor did he cherish silent bitterness.&nbsp;
It was immaterial.&nbsp; The idea&mdash;the fact behind the idea&mdash;was
not changed.&nbsp; Here he was and his thousand dozen; there was Dawson;
the problem was unaltered.</p>
<p>At the Little Salmon, being short of dog food, the dogs got into
his grub, and from there to Selkirk he lived on beans&mdash;coarse,
brown beans, big beans, grossly nutritive, which griped his stomach
and doubled him up at two-hour intervals.&nbsp; But the Factor at Selkirk
had a notice on the door of the Post to the effect that no steamer had
been up the Yukon for two years, and in consequence grub was beyond
price.&nbsp; He offered to swap flour, however, at the rate of a cupful
of each egg, but Rasmunsen shook his head and hit the trail.&nbsp; Below
the Post he managed to buy frozen horse hide for the dogs, the horses
having been slain by the Chilkat cattle men, and the scraps and offal
preserved by the Indians.&nbsp; He tackled the hide himself, but the
hair worked into the bean sores of his mouth, and was beyond endurance.</p>
<p>Here at Selkirk he met the forerunners of the hungry exodus of Dawson,
and from there on they crept over the trail, a dismal throng.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No grub!&rdquo; was the song they sang.&nbsp; &ldquo;No grub,
and had to go.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Everybody holding candles for a rise
in the spring.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Flour dollar &rsquo;n a half a pound,
and no sellers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eggs?&rdquo; one of them answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dollar apiece,
but there ain&rsquo;t none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rasmunsen made a rapid calculation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Twelve thousand
dollars,&rdquo; he said aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; the man asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he answered, and <i>mushed</i> the dogs along.</p>
<p>When he arrived at Stewart River, seventy from Dawson, five of his
dogs were gone, and the remainder were falling in the traces.&nbsp;
He, also, was in the traces, hauling with what little strength was left
in him.&nbsp; Even then he was barely crawling along ten miles a day.&nbsp;
His cheek-bones and nose, frost-bitten again and again, were turned
bloody-black and hideous.&nbsp; The thumb, which was separated from
the fingers by the gee-pole, had likewise been nipped and gave him great
pain.&nbsp; The monstrous moccasin still incased his foot, and strange
pains were beginning to rack the leg.&nbsp; At Sixty Mile, the last
beans, which he had been rationing for some time, were finished; yet
he steadfastly refused to touch the eggs.&nbsp; He could not reconcile
his mind to the legitimacy of it, and staggered and fell along the way
to Indian River.&nbsp; Here a fresh-killed moose and an open-handed
old-timer gave him and his dogs new strength, and at Ainslie&rsquo;s
he felt repaid for it all when a stampede, ripe from Dawson in five
hours, was sure he could get a dollar and a quarter for every egg he
possessed.</p>
<p>He came up the steep bank by the Dawson barracks with fluttering
heart and shaking knees.&nbsp; The dogs were so weak that he was forced
to rest them, and, waiting, he leaned limply against the gee-pole.&nbsp;
A man, an eminently decorous-looking man, came sauntering by in a great
bearskin coat.&nbsp; He glanced at Rasmunsen curiously, then stopped
and ran a speculative eye over the dogs and the three lashed sleds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you got?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eggs,&rdquo; Rasmunsen answered huskily, hardly able to pitch
his voice above a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eggs!&nbsp; Whoopee!&nbsp; Whoopee!&rdquo;&nbsp; He sprang
up into the air, gyrated madly, and finished with half-a-dozen war steps.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say&mdash;all of &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you must be the Egg Man.&rdquo;&nbsp; He walked around
and viewed Rasmunsen from the other side.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, now, ain&rsquo;t
you the Egg Man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rasmunsen didn&rsquo;t know, but supposed he was, and the man sobered
down a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye expect to get for &rsquo;em?&rdquo; he asked
cautiously.</p>
<p>Rasmunsen became audacious. &ldquo;Dollar &rsquo;n a half,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; the man came back promptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gimme
a dozen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I mean a dollar &rsquo;n a half apiece,&rdquo; Rasmunsen
hesitatingly explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&nbsp; I heard you.&nbsp; Make it two dozen.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s
the dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man pulled out a healthy gold sack the size of a small sausage
and knocked it negligently against the gee-pole.&nbsp; Rasmunsen felt
a strange trembling in the pit of his stomach, a tickling of the nostrils,
and an almost overwhelming desire to sit down and cry.&nbsp; But a curious,
wide-eyed crowd was beginning to collect, and man after man was calling
out for eggs.&nbsp; He was without scales, but the man with the bearskin
coat fetched a pair and obligingly weighed in the dust while Rasmunsen
passed out the goods.&nbsp; Soon there was a pushing and shoving and
shouldering, and a great clamour.&nbsp; Everybody wanted to buy and
to be served first.&nbsp; And as the excitement grew, Rasmunsen cooled
down.&nbsp; This would never do.&nbsp; There must be something behind
the fact of their buying so eagerly.&nbsp; It would be wiser if he rested
first and sized up the market.&nbsp; Perhaps eggs were worth two dollars
apiece.&nbsp; Anyway, whenever he wished to sell, he was sure of a dollar
and a half.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he cried, when a couple of hundred
had been sold.&nbsp; &ldquo;No more now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m played out.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve got to get a cabin, and then you can come and see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A groan went up at this, but the man with the bearskin coat approved.&nbsp;
Twenty-four of the frozen eggs went rattling in his capacious pockets,
and he didn&rsquo;t care whether the rest of the town ate or not.&nbsp;
Besides, he could see Rasmunsen was on his last legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a cabin right around the second corner from
the Monte Carlo,&rdquo; he told him&mdash;&ldquo;the one with the sody-bottle
window.&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t mine, but I&rsquo;ve got charge of it.&nbsp;
Rents for ten a day and cheap for the money.&nbsp; You move right in,
and I&rsquo;ll see you later.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t forget the sody-bottle
window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tra-la-loo!&rdquo; he called back a moment later.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo; up the hill to eat eggs and dream of home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On his way to the cabin, Rasmunsen recollected he was hungry and
bought a small supply of provisions at the N. A. T. &amp; T. store&mdash;also
a beefsteak at the butcher shop and dried salmon for the dogs.&nbsp;
He found the cabin without difficulty, and left the dogs in the harness
while he started the fire and got the coffee under way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dollar &rsquo;n a half apiece&mdash;one thousand dozen&mdash;eighteen
thousand dollars!&rdquo; he kept muttering it to himself, over and over,
as he went about his work.</p>
<p>As he flopped the steak into the frying-pan the door opened.&nbsp;
He turned.&nbsp; It was the man with the bearskin coat.&nbsp; He seemed
to come in with determination, as though bound on some explicit errand,
but as he looked at Rasmunsen an expression of perplexity came into
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say&mdash;now I say&mdash;&rdquo; he began, then halted.</p>
<p>Rasmunsen wondered if he wanted the rent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, damn it, you know, them eggs is bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rasmunsen staggered.&nbsp; He felt as though some one had struck
him an astounding blow between the eyes.&nbsp; The walls of the cabin
reeled and tilted up.&nbsp; He put out his hand to steady himself and
rested it on the stove.&nbsp; The sharp pain and the smell of the burning
flesh brought him back to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said slowly, fumbling in his pocket for the
sack.&nbsp; &ldquo;You want your money back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t the money,&rdquo; the man said, &ldquo;but
hain&rsquo;t you got any eggs&mdash;good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rasmunsen shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take the
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the man refused and backed away.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come
back,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;ve taken stock, and get
what&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rasmunsen rolled the chopping-block into the cabin and carried in
the eggs.&nbsp; He went about it quite calmly.&nbsp; He took up the
hand-axe, and, one by one, chopped the eggs in half.&nbsp; These halves
he examined carefully and let fall to the floor.&nbsp; At first he sampled
from the different cases, then deliberately emptied one case at a time.&nbsp;
The heap on the floor grew larger.&nbsp; The coffee boiled over and
the smoke of the burning beefsteak filled the cabin.&nbsp; He chopped
steadfastly and monotonously till the last case was finished.</p>
<p>Somebody knocked at the door, knocked again, and let himself in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a mess!&rdquo; he remarked, as he paused and surveyed
the scene.</p>
<p>The severed eggs were beginning to thaw in the heat of the stove,
and a miserable odour was growing stronger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must a-happened on the steamer,&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>Rasmunsen looked at him long and blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Murray, Big Jim Murray, everybody knows me,&rdquo;
the man volunteered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just hearin&rsquo; your
eggs is rotten, and I&rsquo;m offerin&rsquo; you two hundred for the
batch.&nbsp; They ain&rsquo;t good as salmon, but still they&rsquo;re
fair scoffin&rsquo;s for dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rasmunsen seemed turned to stone.&nbsp; He did not move.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
go to hell,&rdquo; he said passionlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now just consider.&nbsp; I pride myself it&rsquo;s a decent
price for a mess like that, and it&rsquo;s better &rsquo;n nothin&rsquo;.&nbsp;
Two hundred.&nbsp; What you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go to hell,&rdquo; Rasmunsen repeated softly, &ldquo;and
get out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murray gaped with a great awe, then went out carefully, backward,
with his eyes fixed an the other&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Rasmunsen followed him out and turned the dogs loose.&nbsp; He threw
them all the salmon he had bought, and coiled a sled-lashing up in his
hand.&nbsp; Then he re-entered the cabin and drew the latch in after
him.&nbsp; The smoke from the cindered steak made his eyes smart.&nbsp;
He stood on the bunk, passed the lashing over the ridge-pole, and measured
the swing-off with his eye.&nbsp; It did not seem to satisfy, for he
put the stool on the bunk and climbed upon the stool.&nbsp; He drove
a noose in the end of the lashing and slipped his head through.&nbsp;
The other end he made fast.&nbsp; Then he kicked the stool out from
under.</p>
<h2>THE MARRIAGE OF LIT-LIT</h2>
<p>When John Fox came into a country where whisky freezes solid and
may be used as a paper-weight for a large part of the year, he came
without the ideals and illusions that usually hamper the progress of
more delicately nurtured adventurers.&nbsp; Born and reared on the frontier
fringe of the United States, he took with him into Canada a primitive
cast of mind, an elemental simplicity and grip on things, as it were,
that insured him immediate success in his new career.&nbsp; From a mere
servant of the Hudson Bay Company, driving a paddle with the voyageurs
and carrying goods on his back across the portages, he swiftly rose
to a Factorship and took charge of a trading post at Fort Angelus.</p>
<p>Here, because of his elemental simplicity, he took to himself a native
wife, and, by reason of the connubial bliss that followed, he escaped
the unrest and vain longings that curse the days of more fastidious
men, spoil their work, and conquer them in the end.&nbsp; He lived contentedly,
was at single purposes with the business he was set there to do, and
achieved a brilliant record in the service of the Company.&nbsp; About
this time his wife died, was claimed by her people, and buried with
savage circumstance in a tin trunk in the top of a tree.</p>
<p>Two sons she had borne him, and when the Company promoted him, he
journeyed with them still deeper into the vastness of the North-West
Territory to a place called Sin Rock, where he took charge of a new
post in a more important fur field.&nbsp; Here he spent several lonely
and depressing months, eminently disgusted with the unprepossessing
appearance of the Indian maidens, and greatly worried by his growing
sons who stood in need of a mother&rsquo;s care.&nbsp; Then his eyes
chanced upon Lit-lit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lit-lit&mdash;well, she is Lit-lit,&rdquo; was the fashion
in which he despairingly described her to his chief clerk, Alexander
McLean.</p>
<p>McLean was too fresh from his Scottish upbringing&mdash;&ldquo;not
dry behind the ears yet,&rdquo; John Fox put it&mdash;to take to the
marriage customs of the country.&nbsp; Nevertheless he was not averse
to the Factor&rsquo;s imperilling his own immortal soul, and, especially,
feeling an ominous attraction himself for Lit-lit, he was sombrely content
to clinch his own soul&rsquo;s safety by seeing her married to the Factor.</p>
<p>Nor is it to be wondered that McLean&rsquo;s austere Scotch soul
stood in danger of being thawed in the sunshine of Lit-lit&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp;
She was pretty, and slender, and willowy; without the massive face and
temperamental stolidity of the average squaw.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lit-lit,&rdquo;
so called from her fashion, even as a child, of being fluttery, of darting
about from place to place like a butterfly, of being inconsequent and
merry, and of laughing as lightly as she darted and danced about.</p>
<p>Lit-lit was the daughter of Snettishane, a prominent chief in the
tribe, by a half-breed mother, and to him the Factor fared casually
one summer day to open negotiations of marriage.&nbsp; He sat with the
chief in the smoke of a mosquito smudge before his lodge, and together
they talked about everything under the sun, or, at least, everything
that in the Northland is under the sun, with the sole exception of marriage.&nbsp;
John Fox had come particularly to talk of marriage; Snettishane knew
it, and John Fox knew he knew it, wherefore the subject was religiously
avoided.&nbsp; This is alleged to be Indian subtlety.&nbsp; In reality
it is transparent simplicity.</p>
<p>The hours slipped by, and Fox and Snettishane smoked interminable
pipes, looking each other in the eyes with a guilelessness superbly
histrionic.&nbsp; In the mid-afternoon McLean and his brother clerk,
McTavish, strolled past, innocently uninterested, on their way to the
river.&nbsp; When they strolled back again an hour later, Fox and Snettishane
had attained to a ceremonious discussion of the condition and quality
of the gunpowder and bacon which the Company was offering in trade.&nbsp;
Meanwhile Lit-lit, divining the Factor&rsquo;s errand, had crept in
under the rear wall of the lodge, and through the front flap was peeping
out at the two logomachists by the mosquito smudge.&nbsp; She was flushed
and happy-eyed, proud that no less a man than the Factor (who stood
next to God in the Northland hierarchy) had singled her out, femininely
curious to see at close range what manner of man he was.&nbsp; Sunglare
on the ice, camp smoke, and weather beat had burned his face to a copper-brown,
so that her father was as fair as he, while she was fairer.&nbsp; She
was remotely glad of this, and more immediately glad that he was large
and strong, though his great black beard half frightened her, it was
so strange.</p>
<p>Being very young, she was unversed in the ways of men.&nbsp; Seventeen
times she had seen the sun travel south and lose itself beyond the sky-line,
and seventeen times she had seen it travel back again and ride the sky
day and night till there was no night at all.&nbsp; And through these
years she had been cherished jealously by Snettishane, who stood between
her and all suitors, listening disdainfully to the young hunters as
they bid for her hand, and turning them away as though she were beyond
price.&nbsp; Snettishane was mercenary.&nbsp; Lit-lit was to him an
investment.&nbsp; She represented so much capital, from which he expected
to receive, not a certain definite interest, but an incalculable interest.</p>
<p>And having thus been reared in a manner as near to that of the nunnery
as tribal conditions would permit, it was with a great and maidenly
anxiety that she peeped out at the man who had surely come for her,
at the husband who was to teach her all that was yet unlearned of life,
at the masterful being whose word was to be her law, and who was to
mete and bound her actions and comportment for the rest of her days.</p>
<p>But, peeping through the front flap of the lodge, flushed and thrilling
at the strange destiny reaching out for her, she grew disappointed as
the day wore along, and the Factor and her father still talked pompously
of matters concerning other things and not pertaining to marriage things
at all.&nbsp; As the sun sank lower and lower toward the north and midnight
approached, the Factor began making unmistakable preparations for departure.&nbsp;
As he turned to stride away Lit-lit&rsquo;s heart sank; but it rose
again as he halted, half turning on one heel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by the way, Snettishane,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want
a squaw to wash for me and mend my clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snettishane grunted and suggested Wanidani, who was an old woman
and toothless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; interposed the Factor.&nbsp; &ldquo;What I
want is a wife.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been kind of thinking about it, and
the thought just struck me that you might know of some one that would
suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snettishane looked interested, whereupon the Factor retraced his
steps, casually and carelessly to linger and discuss this new and incidental
topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kattou?&rdquo; suggested Snettishane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has but one eye,&rdquo; objected the Factor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laska?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her knees be wide apart when she stands upright.&nbsp; Kips,
your biggest dog, can leap between her knees when she stands upright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senatee?&rdquo; went on the imperturbable Snettishane.</p>
<p>But John Fox feigned anger, crying: &ldquo;What foolishness is this?&nbsp;
Am I old, that thou shouldst mate me with old women?&nbsp; Am I toothless?
lame of leg? blind of eye?&nbsp; Or am I poor that no bright-eyed maiden
may look with favour upon me?&nbsp; Behold!&nbsp; I am the Factor, both
rich and great, a power in the land, whose speech makes men tremble
and is obeyed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snettishane was inwardly pleased, though his sphinx-like visage never
relaxed.&nbsp; He was drawing the Factor, and making him break ground.&nbsp;
Being a creature so elemental as to have room for but one idea at a
time, Snettishane could pursue that one idea a greater distance than
could John Fox.&nbsp; For John Fox, elemental as he was, was still complex
enough to entertain several glimmering ideas at a time, which debarred
him from pursuing the one as single-heartedly or as far as did the chief.</p>
<p>Snettishane calmly continued calling the roster of eligible maidens,
which, name by name, as fast as uttered, were stamped ineligible by
John Fox, with specified objections appended.&nbsp; Again he gave it
up and started to return to the Fort.&nbsp; Snettishane watched him
go, making no effort to stop him, but seeing him, in the end, stop himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to think of it,&rdquo; the Factor remarked, &ldquo;we
both of us forgot Lit-lit.&nbsp; Now I wonder if she&rsquo;ll suit me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snettishane met the suggestion with a mirthless face, behind the
mask of which his soul grinned wide.&nbsp; It was a distinct victory.&nbsp;
Had the Factor gone but one step farther, perforce Snettishane would
himself have mentioned the name of Lit-lit, but&mdash;the Factor had
not gone that one step farther.</p>
<p>The chief was non-committal concerning Lit-lit&rsquo;s suitability,
till he drove the white man into taking the next step in order of procedure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the Factor meditated aloud, &ldquo;the only way
to find out is to make a try of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He raised his voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So I will give for Lit-lit ten blankets and three pounds of tobacco
which is good tobacco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snettishane replied with a gesture which seemed to say that all the
blankets and tobacco in all the world could not compensate him for the
loss of Lit-lit and her manifold virtues.&nbsp; When pressed by the
Factor to set a price, he coolly placed it at five hundred blankets,
ten guns, fifty pounds of tobacco, twenty scarlet cloths, ten bottles
of rum, a music-box, and lastly the good-will and best offices of the
Factor, with a place by his fire.</p>
<p>The Factor apparently suffered a stroke of apoplexy, which stroke
was successful in reducing the blankets to two hundred and in cutting
out the place by the fire&mdash;an unheard-of condition in the marriages
of white men with the daughters of the soil.&nbsp; In the end, after
three hours more of chaffering, they came to an agreement.&nbsp; For
Lit-lit Snettishane was to receive one hundred blankets, five pounds
of tobacco, three guns, and a bottle of rum, goodwill and best offices
included, which according to John Fox, was ten blankets and a gun more
than she was worth.&nbsp; And as he went home through the wee sma&rsquo;
hours, the three-o&rsquo;clock sun blazing in the due north-east, he
was unpleasantly aware that Snettishane had bested him over the bargain.</p>
<p>Snettishane, tired and victorious, sought his bed, and discovered
Lit-lit before she could escape from the lodge.</p>
<p>He grunted knowingly: &ldquo;Thou hast seen.&nbsp; Thou has heard.&nbsp;
Wherefore it be plain to thee thy father&rsquo;s very great wisdom and
understanding.&nbsp; I have made for thee a great match.&nbsp; Heed
my words and walk in the way of my words, go when I say go, come when
I bid thee come, and we shall grow fat with the wealth of this big white
man who is a fool according to his bigness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day no trading was done at the store.&nbsp; The Factor opened
whisky before breakfast, to the delight of McLean and McTavish, gave
his dogs double rations, and wore his best moccasins.&nbsp; Outside
the Fort preparations were under way for a <i>potlatch</i>.&nbsp; Potlatch
means &ldquo;a giving,&rdquo; and John Fox&rsquo;s intention was to
signalize his marriage with Lit-lit by a potlatch as generous as she
was good-looking.&nbsp; In the afternoon the whole tribe gathered to
the feast.&nbsp; Men, women, children, and dogs gorged to repletion,
nor was there one person, even among the chance visitors and stray hunters
from other tribes, who failed to receive some token of the bridegroom&rsquo;s
largess.</p>
<p>Lit-lit, tearfully shy and frightened, was bedecked by her bearded
husband with a new calico dress, splendidly beaded moccasins, a gorgeous
silk handkerchief over her raven hair, a purple scarf about her throat,
brass ear-rings and finger-rings, and a whole pint of pinchbeck jewellery,
including a Waterbury watch.&nbsp; Snettishane could scarce contain
himself at the spectacle, but watching his chance drew her aside from
the feast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this night, nor the next night,&rdquo; he began ponderously,
&ldquo;but in the nights to come, when I shall call like a raven by
the river bank, it is for thee to rise up from thy big husband, who
is a fool, and come to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; he went on hastily, at sight of the dismay
in her face at turning her back upon her wonderful new life.&nbsp; &ldquo;For
no sooner shall this happen than thy big husband, who is a fool, will
come wailing to my lodge.&nbsp; Then it is for thee to wail likewise,
claiming that this thing is not well, and that the other thing thou
dost not like, and that to be the wife of the Factor is more than thou
didst bargain for, only wilt thou be content with more blankets, and
more tobacco, and more wealth of various sorts for thy poor old father,
Snettishane.&nbsp; Remember well, when I call in the night, like a raven,
from the river bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lit-lit nodded; for to disobey her father was a peril she knew well;
and, furthermore, it was a little thing he asked, a short separation
from the Factor, who would know only greater gladness at having her
back.&nbsp; She returned to the feast, and, midnight being well at hand,
the Factor sought her out and led her away to the Fort amid joking and
outcry, in which the squaws were especially conspicuous.</p>
<p>Lit-lit quickly found that married life with the head-man of a fort
was even better than she had dreamed.&nbsp; No longer did she have to
fetch wood and water and wait hand and foot upon cantankerous menfolk.&nbsp;
For the first time in her life she could lie abed till breakfast was
on the table.&nbsp; And what a bed!&mdash;clean and soft, and comfortable
as no bed she had ever known.&nbsp; And such food!&nbsp; Flour, cooked
into biscuits, hot-cakes and bread, three times a day and every day,
and all one wanted!&nbsp; Such prodigality was hardly believable.</p>
<p>To add to her contentment, the Factor was cunningly kind.&nbsp; He
had buried one wife, and he knew how to drive with a slack rein that
went firm only on occasion, and then went very firm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lit-lit
is boss of this place,&rdquo; he announced significantly at the table
the morning after the wedding.&nbsp; &ldquo;What she says goes.&nbsp;
Understand?&rdquo;&nbsp; And McLean and McTavish understood.&nbsp; Also,
they knew that the Factor had a heavy hand.</p>
<p>But Lit-lit did not take advantage.&nbsp; Taking a leaf from the
book of her husband, she at once assumed charge of his own growing sons,
giving them added comforts and a measure of freedom like to that which
he gave her.&nbsp; The two sons were loud in the praise of their new
mother; McLean and McTavish lifted their voices; and the Factor bragged
of the joys of matrimony till the story of her good behaviour and her
husband&rsquo;s satisfaction became the property of all the dwellers
in the Sin Rock district.</p>
<p>Whereupon Snettishane, with visions of his incalculable interest
keeping him awake of nights, thought it time to bestir himself.&nbsp;
On the tenth night of her wedded life Lit-lit was awakened by the croaking
of a raven, and she knew that Snettishane was waiting for her by the
river bank.&nbsp; In her great happiness she had forgotten her pact,
and now it came back to her with behind it all the childish terror of
her father.&nbsp; For a time she lay in fear and trembling, loath to
go, afraid to stay.&nbsp; But in the end the Factor won the silent victory,
and his kindness plus his great muscles and square jaw, nerved her to
disregard Snettishane&rsquo;s call.</p>
<p>But in the morning she arose very much afraid, and went about her
duties in momentary fear of her father&rsquo;s coming.&nbsp; As the
day wore along, however, she began to recover her spirits.&nbsp; John
Fox, soundly berating McLean and McTavish for some petty dereliction
of duty, helped her to pluck up courage.&nbsp; She tried not to let
him go out of her sight, and when she followed him into the huge cache
and saw him twirling and tossing great bales around as though they were
feather pillows, she felt strengthened in her disobedience to her father.&nbsp;
Also (it was her first visit to the warehouse, and Sin Rock was the
chief distributing point to several chains of lesser posts), she was
astounded at the endlessness of the wealth there stored away.</p>
<p>This sight and the picture in her mind&rsquo;s eye of the bare lodge
of Snettishane, put all doubts at rest.&nbsp; Yet she capped her conviction
by a brief word with one of her step-sons.&nbsp; &ldquo;White daddy
good?&rdquo; was what she asked, and the boy answered that his father
was the best man he had ever known.&nbsp; That night the raven croaked
again.&nbsp; On the night following the croaking was more persistent.&nbsp;
It awoke the Factor, who tossed restlessly for a while.&nbsp; Then he
said aloud, &ldquo;Damn that raven,&rdquo; and Lit-lit laughed quietly
under the blankets.</p>
<p>In the morning, bright and early, Snettishane put in an ominous appearance
and was set to breakfast in the kitchen with Wanidani.&nbsp; He refused
&ldquo;squaw food,&rdquo; and a little later bearded his son-in-law
in the store where the trading was done.&nbsp; Having learned, he said,
that his daughter was such a jewel, he had come for more blankets, more
tobacco, and more guns&mdash;especially more guns.&nbsp; He had certainly
been cheated in her price, he held, and he had come for justice.&nbsp;
But the Factor had neither blankets nor justice to spare.&nbsp; Whereupon
he was informed that Snettishane had seen the missionary at Three Forks,
who had notified him that such marriages were not made in heaven, and
that it was his father&rsquo;s duty to demand his daughter back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am good Christian man now,&rdquo; Snettishane concluded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I want my Lit-lit to go to heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Factor&rsquo;s reply was short and to the point; for he directed
his father-in-law to go to the heavenly antipodes, and by the scruff
of the neck and the slack of the blanket propelled him on that trail
as far as the door.</p>
<p>But Snettishane sneaked around and in by the kitchen, cornering Lit-lit
in the great living-room of the Fort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mayhap thou didst sleep over-sound last night when I called
by the river bank,&rdquo; he began, glowering darkly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, I was awake and heard.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her heart was beating
as though it would choke her, but she went on steadily, &ldquo;And the
night before I was awake and heard, and yet again the night before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thereat, out of her great happiness and out of the fear that
it might be taken from her, she launched into an original and glowing
address upon the status and rights of woman&mdash;the first new-woman
lecture delivered north of Fifty-three.</p>
<p>But it fell on unheeding ears.&nbsp; Snettishane was still in the
dark ages.&nbsp; As she paused for breath, he said threateningly, &ldquo;To-night
I shall call again like the raven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the Factor entered the room and again helped Snettishane
on his way to the heavenly antipodes.</p>
<p>That night the raven croaked more persistently than ever.&nbsp; Lit-lit,
who was a light sleeper, heard and smiled.&nbsp; John Fox tossed restlessly.&nbsp;
Then he awoke and tossed about with greater restlessness.&nbsp; He grumbled
and snorted, swore under his breath and over his breath, and finally
flung out of bed.&nbsp; He groped his way to the great living-room,
and from the rack took down a loaded shot-gun&mdash;loaded with bird-shot,
left therein by the careless McTavish.</p>
<p>The Factor crept carefully out of the Fort and down to the river.&nbsp;
The croaking had ceased, but he stretched out in the long grass and
waited.&nbsp; The air seemed a chilly balm, and the earth, after the
heat of the day, now and again breathed soothingly against him.&nbsp;
The Factor, gathered into the rhythm of it all, dozed off, with his
head upon his arm, and slept.</p>
<p>Fifty yards away, head resting on knees, and with his back to John
Fox, Snettishane likewise slept, gently conquered by the quietude of
the night.&nbsp; An hour slipped by and then he awoke, and, without
lifting his head, set the night vibrating with the hoarse gutturals
of the raven call.</p>
<p>The Factor roused, not with the abrupt start of civilized man, but
with the swift and comprehensive glide from sleep to waking of the savage.&nbsp;
In the night-light he made out a dark object in the midst of the grass
and brought his gun to bear upon it.&nbsp; A second croak began to rise,
and he pulled the trigger.&nbsp; The crickets ceased from their sing-song
chant, the wildfowl from their squabbling, and the raven croak broke
midmost and died away in gasping silence.</p>
<p>John Fox ran to the spot and reached for the thing he had killed,
but his fingers closed on a coarse mop of hair and he turned Snettishane&rsquo;s
face upward to the starlight.&nbsp; He knew how a shotgun scattered
at fifty yards, and he knew that he had peppered Snettishane across
the shoulders and in the small of the back.&nbsp; And Snettishane knew
that he knew, but neither referred to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What dost thou here?&rdquo; the Factor demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
were time old bones should be in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Snettishane was stately in spite of the bird-shot burning under
his skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old bones will not sleep,&rdquo; he said solemnly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
weep for my daughter, for my daughter Lit-lit, who liveth and who yet
is dead, and who goeth without doubt to the white man&rsquo;s hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weep henceforth on the far bank, beyond ear-shot of the Fort,&rdquo;
said John Fox, turning on his heel, &ldquo;for the noise of thy weeping
is exceeding great and will not let one sleep of nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart is sore,&rdquo; Snettishane answered, &ldquo;and
my days and nights be black with sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the raven is black,&rdquo; said John Fox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the raven is black,&rdquo; Snettishane said.</p>
<p>Never again was the voice of the raven heard by the river bank.&nbsp;
Lit-lit grows matronly day by day and is very happy.&nbsp; Also, there
are sisters to the sons of John Fox&rsquo;s first wife who lies buried
in a tree.&nbsp; Old Snettishane is no longer a visitor at the Fort,
and spends long hours raising a thin, aged voice against the filial
ingratitude of children in general and of his daughter Lit-lit in particular.&nbsp;
His declining years are embittered by the knowledge that he was cheated,
and even John Fox has withdrawn the assertion that the price for Lit-lit
was too much by ten blankets and a gun.</p>
<h2>B&Acirc;TARD</h2>
<p>B&acirc;tard was a devil.&nbsp; This was recognized throughout the
Northland.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s Spawn&rdquo; he was called by many
men, but his master, Black Lecl&egrave;re, chose for him the shameful
name &ldquo;B&acirc;tard.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now Black Lecl&egrave;re was
also a devil, and the twain were well matched.&nbsp; There is a saying
that when two devils come together, hell is to pay.&nbsp; This is to
be expected, and this certainly was to be expected when B&acirc;tard
and Black Lecl&egrave;re came together.&nbsp; The first time they met,
B&acirc;tard was a part-grown puppy, lean and hungry, with bitter eyes;
and they met with snap and snarl, and wicked looks, for Lecl&egrave;re&rsquo;s
upper lip had a wolfish way of lifting and showing the white, cruel
teeth.&nbsp; And it lifted then, and his eyes glinted viciously, as
he reached for B&acirc;tard and dragged him out from the squirming litter.&nbsp;
It was certain that they divined each other, for on the instant B&acirc;tard
had buried his puppy fangs in Lecl&egrave;re&rsquo;s hand, and Lecl&egrave;re,
thumb and finger, was coolly choking his young life out of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sacredam</i>,&rdquo; the Frenchman said softly, flirting
the quick blood from his bitten hand and gazing down on the little puppy
choking and gasping in the snow.</p>
<p>Lecl&egrave;re turned to John Hamlin, storekeeper of the Sixty Mile
Post.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dat fo&rsquo; w&rsquo;at Ah lak heem.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ow
moch, eh, you, <i>M&rsquo;sieu</i>&rsquo;?&nbsp; &lsquo;Ow moch?&nbsp;
Ah buy heem, now; Ah buy heem queek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And because he hated him with an exceeding bitter hate, Lecl&egrave;re
bought B&acirc;tard and gave him his shameful name.&nbsp; And for five
years the twain adventured across the Northland, from St. Michael&rsquo;s
and the Yukon delta to the head-reaches of the Pelly and even so far
as the Peace River, Athabasca, and the Great Slave.&nbsp; And they acquired
a reputation for uncompromising wickedness, the like of which never
before attached itself to man and dog.</p>
<p>B&acirc;tard did not know his father&mdash;hence his name&mdash;but,
as John Hamlin knew, his father was a great grey timber wolf.&nbsp;
But the mother of B&acirc;tard, as he dimly remembered her, was snarling,
bickering, obscene, husky, full-fronted and heavy-chested, with a malign
eye, a cat-like grip on life, and a genius for trickery and evil.&nbsp;
There was neither faith nor trust in her.&nbsp; Her treachery alone
could be relied upon, and her wild-wood amours attested her general
depravity.&nbsp; Much of evil and much of strength were there in these,
B&acirc;tard&rsquo;s progenitors, and, bone and flesh of their bone
and flesh, he had inherited it all.&nbsp; And then came Black Lecl&egrave;re,
to lay his heavy hand on the bit of pulsating puppy life, to press and
prod and mould till it became a big bristling beast, acute in knavery,
overspilling with hate, sinister, malignant, diabolical.&nbsp; With
a proper master B&acirc;tard might have made an ordinary, fairly efficient
sled-dog.&nbsp; He never got the chance: Lecl&egrave;re but confirmed
him in his congenital iniquity.</p>
<p>The history of B&acirc;tard and Lecl&egrave;re is a history of war&mdash;of
five cruel, relentless years, of which their first meeting is fit summary.&nbsp;
To begin with, it was Lecl&egrave;re&rsquo;s fault, for he hated with
understanding and intelligence, while the long-legged, ungainly puppy
hated only blindly, instinctively, without reason or method.&nbsp; At
first there were no refinements of cruelty (these were to come later),
but simple beatings and crude brutalities.&nbsp; In one of these B&acirc;tard
had an ear injured.&nbsp; He never regained control of the riven muscles,
and ever after the ear drooped limply down to keep keen the memory of
his tormentor.&nbsp; And he never forgot.</p>
<p>His puppyhood was a period of foolish rebellion.&nbsp; He was always
worsted, but he fought back because it was his nature to fight back.&nbsp;
And he was unconquerable.&nbsp; Yelping shrilly from the pain of lash
and club, he none the less contrived always to throw in the defiant
snarl, the bitter vindictive menace of his soul which fetched without
fail more blows and beatings.&nbsp; But his was his mother&rsquo;s tenacious
grip on life.&nbsp; Nothing could kill him.&nbsp; He flourished under
misfortune, grew fat with famine, and out of his terrible struggle for
life developed a preternatural intelligence.&nbsp; His were the stealth
and cunning of the husky, his mother, and the fierceness and valour
of the wolf, his father.</p>
<p>Possibly it was because of his father that he never wailed.&nbsp;
His puppy yelps passed with his lanky legs, so that he became grim and
taciturn, quick to strike, slow to warn.&nbsp; He answered curse with
snarl, and blow with snap, grinning the while his implacable hatred;
but never again, under the extremest agony, did Lecl&egrave;re bring
from him the cry of fear nor of pain.&nbsp; This unconquerableness but
fanned Lecl&egrave;re&rsquo;s wrath and stirred him to greater deviltries.</p>
<p>Did Lecl&egrave;re give B&acirc;tard half a fish and to his mates
whole ones, B&acirc;tard went forth to rob other dogs of their fish.&nbsp;
Also he robbed caches and expressed himself in a thousand rogueries,
till he became a terror to all dogs and masters of dogs.&nbsp; Did Lecl&egrave;re
beat B&acirc;tard and fondle Babette&mdash;Babette who was not half
the worker he was&mdash;why, B&acirc;tard threw her down in the snow
and broke her hind leg in his heavy jaws, so that Lecl&egrave;re was
forced to shoot her.&nbsp; Likewise, in bloody battles, B&acirc;tard
mastered all his team-mates, set them the law of trail and forage, and
made them live to the law he set.</p>
<p>In five years he heard but one kind word, received but one soft stroke
of a hand, and then he did not know what manner of things they were.&nbsp;
He leaped like the untamed thing he was, and his jaws were together
in a flash.&nbsp; It was the missionary at Sunrise, a newcomer in the
country, who spoke the kind word and gave the soft stroke of the hand.&nbsp;
And for six months after, he wrote no letters home to the States, and
the surgeon at McQuestion travelled two hundred miles on the ice to
save him from blood-poisoning.</p>
<p>Men and dogs looked askance at B&acirc;tard when he drifted into
their camps and posts.&nbsp; The men greeted him with feet threateningly
lifted for the kick, the dogs with bristling manes and bared fangs.&nbsp;
Once a man did kick B&acirc;tard, and B&acirc;tard, with quick wolf
snap, closed his jaws like a steel trap on the man&rsquo;s calf and
crunched down to the bone.&nbsp; Whereat the man was determined to have
his life, only Black Lecl&egrave;re, with ominous eyes and naked hunting-knife,
stepped in between.&nbsp; The killing of B&acirc;tard&mdash;ah, <i>sacredam</i>,
<i>that</i> was a pleasure Lecl&egrave;re reserved for himself.&nbsp;
Some day it would happen, or else&mdash;bah! who was to know?&nbsp;
Anyway, the problem would be solved.</p>
<p>For they had become problems to each other.&nbsp; The very breath
each drew was a challenge and a menace to the other.&nbsp; Their hate
bound them together as love could never bind.&nbsp; Lecl&egrave;re was
bent on the coming of the day when B&acirc;tard should wilt in spirit
and cringe and whimper at his feet.&nbsp; And B&acirc;tard&mdash;Lecl&egrave;re
knew what was in B&acirc;tard&rsquo;s mind, and more than once had read
it in B&acirc;tard&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; And so clearly had he read, that
when B&acirc;tard was at his back, he made it a point to glance often
over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Men marvelled when Lecl&egrave;re refused large money for the dog.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Some day you&rsquo;ll kill him and be out his price,&rdquo; said
John Hamlin once, when B&acirc;tard lay panting in the snow where Lecl&egrave;re
had kicked him, and no one knew whether his ribs were broken, and no
one dared look to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat,&rdquo; said Lecl&egrave;re, dryly, &ldquo;dat is my biz&rsquo;ness,
<i>M&rsquo;sieu</i>&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the men marvelled that B&acirc;tard did not run away.&nbsp; They
did not understand.&nbsp; But Lecl&egrave;re understood.&nbsp; He was
a man who lived much in the open, beyond the sound of human tongue,
and he had learned the voices of wind and storm, the sigh of night,
the whisper of dawn, the clash of day.&nbsp; In a dim way he could hear
the green things growing, the running of the sap, the bursting of the
bud.&nbsp; And he knew the subtle speech of the things that moved, of
the rabbit in the snare, the moody raven beating the air with hollow
wing, the baldface shuffling under the moon, the wolf like a grey shadow
gliding betwixt the twilight and the dark.&nbsp; And to him B&acirc;tard
spoke clear and direct.&nbsp; Full well he understood why B&acirc;tard
did not run away, and he looked more often over his shoulder.</p>
<p>When in anger, B&acirc;tard was not nice to look upon, and more than
once had he leapt for Lecl&egrave;re&rsquo;s throat, to be stretched
quivering and senseless in the snow, by the butt of the ever ready dogwhip.&nbsp;
And so B&acirc;tard learned to bide his time.&nbsp; When he reached
his full strength and prime of youth, he thought the time had come.&nbsp;
He was broad-chested, powerfully muscled, of far more than ordinary
size, and his neck from head to shoulders was a mass of bristling hair&mdash;to
all appearances a full-blooded wolf.&nbsp; Lecl&egrave;re was lying
asleep in his furs when B&acirc;tard deemed the time to be ripe.&nbsp;
He crept upon him stealthily, head low to earth and lone ear laid back,
with a feline softness of tread.&nbsp; B&acirc;tard breathed gently,
very gently, and not till he was close at hand did he raise his head.&nbsp;
He paused for a moment and looked at the bronzed bull throat, naked
and knotty, and swelling to a deep steady pulse.&nbsp; The slaver dripped
down his fangs and slid off his tongue at the sight, and in that moment
he remembered his drooping ear, his uncounted blows and prodigious wrongs,
and without a sound sprang on the sleeping man.</p>
<p>Lecl&egrave;re awoke to the pang of the fangs in his throat, and,
perfect animal that he was, he awoke clear-headed and with full comprehension.&nbsp;
He closed on B&acirc;tard&rsquo;s windpipe with both his hands, and
rolled out of his furs to get his weight uppermost.&nbsp; But the thousands
of B&acirc;tard&rsquo;s ancestors had clung at the throats of unnumbered
moose and caribou and dragged them down, and the wisdom of those ancestors
was his.&nbsp; When Lecl&egrave;re&rsquo;s weight came on top of him,
he drove his hind legs upwards and in, and clawed down chest and abdomen,
ripping and tearing through skin and muscle.&nbsp; And when he felt
the man&rsquo;s body wince above him and lift, he worried and shook
at the man&rsquo;s throat.&nbsp; His team-mates closed around in a snarling
circle, and B&acirc;tard, with failing breath and fading sense, knew
that their jaws were hungry for him.&nbsp; But that did not matter&mdash;it
was the man, the man above him, and he ripped and clawed, and shook
and worried, to the last ounce of his strength.&nbsp; But Lecl&egrave;re
choked him with both his hands, till B&acirc;tard&rsquo;s chest heaved
and writhed for the air denied, and his eyes glazed and set, and his
jaws slowly loosened, and his tongue protruded black and swollen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&nbsp; <i>Bon</i>, you devil!&rdquo; Lecl&egrave;re gurgled
mouth and throat clogged with his own blood, as he shoved the dizzy
dog from him.</p>
<p>And then Lecl&egrave;re cursed the other dogs off as they fell upon
B&acirc;tard.&nbsp; They drew back into a wider circle, squatting alertly
on their haunches and licking their chops, the hair on every neck bristling
and erect.</p>
<p>B&acirc;tard recovered quickly, and at sound of Lecl&egrave;re&rsquo;s
voice, tottered to his feet and swayed weakly back and forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A-h-ah!&nbsp; You beeg devil!&rdquo; Lecl&egrave;re spluttered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah fix you; Ah fix you plentee, by <i>Gar</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>B&acirc;tard, the air biting into his exhausted lungs like wine,
flashed full into the man&rsquo;s face, his jaws missing and coming
together with a metallic clip.&nbsp; They rolled over and over on the
snow, Lecl&egrave;re striking madly with his fists.&nbsp; Then they
separated, face to face, and circled back and forth before each other.&nbsp;
Lecl&egrave;re could have drawn his knife.&nbsp; His rifle was at his
feet.&nbsp; But the beast in him was up and raging.&nbsp; He would do
the thing with his hands&mdash;and his teeth.&nbsp; B&acirc;tard sprang
in, but Lecl&egrave;re knocked him over with a blow of the fist, fell
upon him, and buried his teeth to the bone in the dog&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>It was a primordial setting and a primordial scene, such as might
have been in the savage youth of the world.&nbsp; An open space in a
dark forest, a ring of grinning wolf-dogs, and in the centre two beasts,
locked in combat, snapping and snarling raging madly about panting,
sobbing, cursing, straining, wild with passion, in a fury of murder,
ripping and tearing and clawing in elemental brutishness.</p>
<p>But Lecl&egrave;re caught B&acirc;tard behind the ear with a blow
from his fist, knocking him over, and, for the instant, stunning him.&nbsp;
Then Lecl&egrave;re leaped upon him with his feet, and sprang up and
down, striving to grind him into the earth.&nbsp; Both B&acirc;tard&rsquo;s
hind legs were broken ere Lecl&egrave;re ceased that he might catch
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A-a-ah!&nbsp; A-a-ah!&rdquo; he screamed, incapable of speech,
shaking his fist, through sheer impotence of throat and larynx.</p>
<p>But B&acirc;tard was indomitable.&nbsp; He lay there in a helpless
welter, his lip feebly lifting and writhing to the snarl he had not
the strength to utter.&nbsp; Lecl&egrave;re kicked him, and the tired
jaws closed on the ankle, but could not break the skin.</p>
<p>Then Lecl&egrave;re picked up the whip and proceeded almost to cut
him to pieces, at each stroke of the lash crying: &ldquo;Dis taim Ah
break you!&nbsp; Eh?&nbsp; By <i>Gar</i>!&nbsp; Ah break you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end, exhausted, fainting from loss of blood, he crumpled up
and fell by his victim, and when the wolf-dogs closed in to take their
vengeance, with his last consciousness dragged his body on top of B&acirc;tard
to shield him from their fangs.</p>
<p>This occurred not far from Sunrise, and the missionary, opening the
door to Lecl&egrave;re a few hours later, was surprised to note the
absence of B&acirc;tard from the team.&nbsp; Nor did his surprise lessen
when Lecl&egrave;re threw back the robes from the sled, gathered B&acirc;tard
into his arms and staggered across the threshold.&nbsp; It happened
that the surgeon of McQuestion, who was something of a gadabout, was
up on a gossip, and between them they proceeded to repair Lecl&egrave;re,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Merci</i>, <i>non</i>,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
you fix firs&rsquo; de dog.&nbsp; To die?&nbsp; <i>Non</i>.&nbsp; Eet
is not good.&nbsp; Becos&rsquo; heem Ah mus&rsquo; yet break.&nbsp;
Dat fo&rsquo; w&rsquo;at he mus&rsquo; not die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The surgeon called it a marvel, the missionary a miracle, that Lecl&egrave;re
pulled through at all; and so weakened was he, that in the spring the
fever got him, and he went on his back again.&nbsp; B&acirc;tard had
been in even worse plight, but his grip on life prevailed, and the bones
of his hind legs knit, and his organs righted themselves, during the
several weeks he lay strapped to the floor.&nbsp; And by the time Lecl&egrave;re,
finally convalescent, sallow and shaky, took the sun by the cabin door,
B&acirc;tard had reasserted his supremacy among his kind, and brought
not only his own team-mates but the missionary&rsquo;s dogs into subjection.</p>
<p>He moved never a muscle, nor twitched a hair, when, for the first
time, Lecl&egrave;re tottered out on the missionary&rsquo;s arm, and
sank down slowly and with infinite caution on the three-legged stool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bon</i>!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Bon</i>!&nbsp;
De good sun!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he stretched out his wasted hands and
washed them in the warmth.</p>
<p>Then his gaze fell on the dog, and the old light blazed back in his
eyes.&nbsp; He touched the missionary lightly on the arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Mon</i>
<i>p&egrave;re</i>, dat is one beeg devil, dat B&acirc;tard.&nbsp; You
will bring me one pistol, so, dat Ah drink de sun in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thenceforth for many days he sat in the sun before the cabin
door.&nbsp; He never dozed, and the pistol lay always across his knees.&nbsp;
B&acirc;tard had a way, the first thing each day, of looking for the
weapon in its wonted place.&nbsp; At sight of it he would lift his lip
faintly in token that he understood, and Lecl&egrave;re would lift his
own lip in an answering grin.&nbsp; One day the missionary took note
of the trick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I really believe the
brute comprehends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lecl&egrave;re laughed softly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look you, <i>mon</i>
<i>p&egrave;re</i>.&nbsp; Dat w&rsquo;at Ah now spik, to dat does he
lissen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if in confirmation, B&acirc;tard just perceptibly wriggled his
lone ear up to catch the sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah say &lsquo;keel&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>B&acirc;tard growled deep down in his throat, the hair bristled along
his neck, and every muscle went tense and expectant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah lift de gun, so, like dat.&rdquo;&nbsp; And suiting action
to word, he sighted the pistol at B&acirc;tard.&nbsp; B&acirc;tard,
with a single leap, sideways, landed around the corner of the cabin
out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; he repeated at intervals.&nbsp; Lecl&egrave;re
grinned proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why does he not run away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Frenchman&rsquo;s shoulders went up in the racial shrug that
means all things from total ignorance to infinite understanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you not kill him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the shoulders went up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon</i> <i>p&egrave;re</i>,&rdquo; he said after a pause,
&ldquo;de taim is not yet.&nbsp; He is one beeg devil.&nbsp; Some taim
Ah break heem, so an&rsquo; so, all to leetle bits.&nbsp; Hey? some
taim.&nbsp; <i>Bon</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A day came when Lecl&egrave;re gathered his dogs together and floated
down in a bateau to Forty Mile, and on to the Porcupine, where he took
a commission from the P. C. Company, and went exploring for the better
part of a year.&nbsp; After that he poled up the Koyokuk to deserted
Arctic City, and later came drifting back, from camp to camp, along
the Yukon.&nbsp; And during the long months B&acirc;tard was well lessoned.&nbsp;
He learned many tortures, and, notably, the torture of hunger, the torture
of thirst, the torture of fire, and, worst of all, the torture of music.</p>
<p>Like the rest of his kind, he did not enjoy music.&nbsp; It gave
him exquisite anguish, racking him nerve by nerve, and ripping apart
every fibre of his being.&nbsp; It made him howl, long and wolf-life,
as when the wolves bay the stars on frosty nights.&nbsp; He could not
help howling.&nbsp; It was his one weakness in the contest with Lecl&egrave;re,
and it was his shame.&nbsp; Lecl&egrave;re, on the other hand, passionately
loved music&mdash;as passionately as he loved strong drink.&nbsp; And
when his soul clamoured for expression, it usually uttered itself in
one or the other of the two ways, and more usually in both ways.&nbsp;
And when he had drunk, his brain a-lilt with unsung song and the devil
in him aroused and rampant, his soul found its supreme utterance in
torturing B&acirc;tard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we will haf a leetle museek,&rdquo; he would say.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Eh?&nbsp; W&rsquo;at you t&rsquo;ink, B&acirc;tard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only an old and battered harmonica, tenderly treasured and
patiently repaired; but it was the best that money could buy, and out
of its silver reeds he drew weird vagrant airs that men had never heard
before.&nbsp; Then B&acirc;tard, dumb of throat, with teeth tight clenched,
would back away, inch by inch, to the farthest cabin corner.&nbsp; And
Lecl&egrave;re, playing, playing, a stout club tucked under his arm,
followed the animal up, inch by inch, step by step, till there was no
further retreat.</p>
<p>At first B&acirc;tard would crowd himself into the smallest possible
space, grovelling close to the floor; but as the music came nearer and
nearer, he was forced to uprear, his back jammed into the logs, his
fore legs fanning the air as though to beat off the rippling waves of
sound.&nbsp; He still kept his teeth together, but severe muscular contractions
attacked his body, strange twitchings and jerkings, till he was all
a-quiver and writhing in silent torment.&nbsp; As he lost control, his
jaws spasmodically wrenched apart, and deep throaty vibrations issued
forth, too low in the register of sound for human ear to catch.&nbsp;
And then, nostrils distended, eyes dilated, hair bristling in helpless
rage, arose the long wolf howl.&nbsp; It came with a slurring rush upwards,
swelling to a great heart-breaking burst of sound, and dying away in
sadly cadenced woe&mdash;then the next rush upward, octave upon octave;
the bursting heart; and the infinite sorrow and misery, fainting, fading,
falling, and dying slowly away.</p>
<p>It was fit for hell.&nbsp; And Lecl&egrave;re, with fiendish ken,
seemed to divine each particular nerve and heartstring, and with long
wails and tremblings and sobbing minors to make it yield up its last
shred of grief.&nbsp; It was frightful, and for twenty-four hours after,
B&acirc;tard was nervous and unstrung, starting at common sounds, tripping
over his own shadow, but, withal, vicious and masterful with his team-mates.&nbsp;
Nor did he show signs of a breaking spirit.&nbsp; Rather did he grow
more grim and taciturn, biding his time with an inscrutable patience
that began to puzzle and weigh upon Lecl&egrave;re.&nbsp; The dog would
lie in the firelight, motionless, for hours, gazing straight before
him at Lecl&egrave;re, and hating him with his bitter eyes.</p>
<p>Often the man felt that he had bucked against the very essence of
life&mdash;the unconquerable essence that swept the hawk down out of
the sky like a feathered thunderbolt, that drove the great grey goose
across the zones, that hurled the spawning salmon through two thousand
miles of boiling Yukon flood.&nbsp; At such times he felt impelled to&mdash;express
his own unconquerable essence; and with strong drink, wild music, and
B&acirc;tard, he indulged in vast orgies, wherein he pitted his puny
strength in the face of things, and challenged all that was, and had
been, and was yet to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dere is somet&rsquo;ing dere,&rdquo; he affirmed, when the
rhythmed vagaries of his mind touched the secret chords of B&acirc;tard&rsquo;s
being and brought forth the long lugubrious howl.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah pool
eet out wid bot&rsquo; my han&rsquo;s, so, an&rsquo; so.&nbsp; Ha! ha!&nbsp;
Eet is fonee!&nbsp; Eet is ver&rsquo; fonee!&nbsp; De priest chant,
de womans pray, de mans swear, de leetle bird go <i>peep</i>-<i>peep</i>,
B&acirc;tard, heem go <i>yow</i>-<i>yow</i>&mdash;an&rsquo; eet is all
de ver&rsquo; same t&rsquo;ing.&nbsp; Ha! ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Gautier, a worthy priest, one reproved him with instances
of concrete perdition.&nbsp; He never reproved him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eet may be so, <i>mon</i> <i>p&egrave;re</i>,&rdquo; he made
answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; Ah t&rsquo;ink Ah go troo hell a-snappin&rsquo;,
lak de hemlock troo de fire.&nbsp; Eh, <i>mon</i> <i>p&egrave;re</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But all bad things come to an end as well as good, and so with Black
Lecl&egrave;re.&nbsp; On the summer low water, in a poling boat, he
left McDougall for Sunrise.&nbsp; He left McDougall in company with
Timothy Brown, and arrived at Sunrise by himself.&nbsp; Further, it
was known that they had quarrelled just previous to pulling out; for
the <i>Lizzie</i>, a wheezy ten-ton stern-wheeler, twenty-four hours
behind, beat Lecl&egrave;re in by three days.&nbsp; And when he did
get in, it was with a clean-drilled bullet-hole through his shoulder
muscle, and a tale of ambush and murder.</p>
<p>A strike had been made at Sunrise, and things had changed considerably.&nbsp;
With the infusion of several hundred gold-seekers, a deal of whisky,
and half-a-dozen equipped gamblers, the missionary had seen the page
of his years of labour with the Indians wiped clean.&nbsp; When the
squaws became preoccupied with cooking beans and keeping the fire going
for the wifeless miners, and the bucks with swapping their warm furs
for black bottles and broken time-pieces, he took to his bed, said &ldquo;Bless
me&rdquo; several times, and departed to his final accounting in a rough-hewn,
oblong box.&nbsp; Whereupon the gamblers moved their roulette and faro
tables into the mission house, and the click of chips and clink of glasses
went up from dawn till dark and to dawn again.</p>
<p>Now Timothy Brown was well beloved among these adventurers of the
North.&nbsp; The one thing against him was his quick temper and ready
fist&mdash;a little thing, for which his kind heart and forgiving hand
more than atoned.&nbsp; On the other hand, there was nothing to atone
for Black Lecl&egrave;re.&nbsp; He was &ldquo;black,&rdquo; as more
than one remembered deed bore witness, while he was as well hated as
the other was beloved.&nbsp; So the men of Sunrise put an antiseptic
dressing on his shoulder and haled him before Judge Lynch.</p>
<p>It was a simple affair.&nbsp; He had quarrelled with Timothy Brown
at McDougall.&nbsp; With Timothy Brown he had left McDougall.&nbsp;
Without Timothy Brown he had arrived at Sunrise.&nbsp; Considered in
the light of his evilness, the unanimous conclusion was that he had
killed Timothy Brown.&nbsp; On the other hand, Lecl&egrave;re acknowledged
their facts, but challenged their conclusion, and gave his own explanation.&nbsp;
Twenty miles out of Sunrise he and Timothy Brown were poling the boat
along the rocky shore.&nbsp; From that shore two rifle-shots rang out.&nbsp;
Timothy Brown pitched out of the boat and went down bubbling red, and
that was the last of Timothy Brown.&nbsp; He, Lecl&egrave;re, pitched
into the bottom of the boat with a stinging shoulder.&nbsp; He lay very
quiet, peeping at the shore.&nbsp; After a time two Indians stuck up
their heads and came out to the water&rsquo;s edge, carrying between
them a birch-bark canoe.&nbsp; As they launched it, Lecl&egrave;re let
fly.&nbsp; He potted one, who went over the side after the manner of
Timothy Brown.&nbsp; The other dropped into the bottom of the canoe,
and then canoe and poling boat went down the stream in a drifting battle.&nbsp;
After that they hung up on a split current, and the canoe passed on
one side of an island, the poling boat on the other.&nbsp; That was
the last of the canoe, and he came on into Sunrise.&nbsp; Yes, from
the way the Indian in the canoe jumped, he was sure he had potted him.&nbsp;
That was all.&nbsp; This explanation was not deemed adequate.&nbsp;
They gave him ten hours&rsquo; grace while the <i>Lizzie</i> steamed
down to investigate.&nbsp; Ten hours later she came wheezing back to
Sunrise.&nbsp; There had been nothing to investigate.&nbsp; No evidence
had been found to back up his statements.&nbsp; They told him to make
his will, for he possessed a fifty-thousand dollar Sunrise claim, and
they were a law-abiding as well as a law-giving breed.</p>
<p>Lecl&egrave;re shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bot one t&rsquo;ing,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;a leetle, w&rsquo;at you call, favour&mdash;a leetle
favour, dat is eet.&nbsp; I gif my feefty t&rsquo;ousan&rsquo; dollair
to de church.&nbsp; I gif my husky dog, B&acirc;tard, to de devil.&nbsp;
De leetle favour?&nbsp; Firs&rsquo; you hang heem, an&rsquo; den you
hang me.&nbsp; Eet is good, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Good it was, they agreed, that Hell&rsquo;s Spawn should break trail
for his master across the last divide, and the court was adjourned down
to the river bank, where a big spruce tree stood by itself.&nbsp; Slackwater
Charley put a hangman&rsquo;s knot in the end of a hauling-line, and
the noose was slipped over Lecl&egrave;re&rsquo;s head and pulled tight
around his neck.&nbsp; His hands were tied behind his back, and he was
assisted to the top of a cracker box.&nbsp; Then the running end of
the line was passed over an over-hanging branch, drawn taut, and made
fast.&nbsp; To kick the box out from under would leave him dancing on
the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the dog,&rdquo; said Webster Shaw, sometime mining
engineer.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to rope him, Slackwater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lecl&egrave;re grinned.&nbsp; Slackwater took a chew of tobacco,
rove a running noose, and proceeded leisurely to coil a few turns in
his hand.&nbsp; He paused once or twice to brush particularly offensive
mosquitoes from off his face.&nbsp; Everybody was brushing mosquitoes,
except Lecl&egrave;re, about whose head a small cloud was visible.&nbsp;
Even B&acirc;tard, lying full-stretched on the ground with his fore
paws rubbed the pests away from eyes and mouth.</p>
<p>But while Slackwater waited for B&acirc;tard to lift his head, a
faint call came from the quiet air, and a man was seen waving his arms
and running across the flat from Sunrise.&nbsp; It was the storekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;C-call &rsquo;er off, boys,&rdquo; he panted, as he came in
among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Sandy and Bernadotte&rsquo;s jes&rsquo; got in,&rdquo;
he explained with returning breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;Landed down below an&rsquo;
come up by the short cut.&nbsp; Got the Beaver with &rsquo;m.&nbsp;
Picked &rsquo;m up in his canoe, stuck in a back channel, with a couple
of bullet-holes in &rsquo;m.&nbsp; Other buck was Klok Kutz, the one
that knocked spots out of his squaw and dusted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&nbsp; W&rsquo;at Ah say?&nbsp; Eh?&rdquo; Lecl&egrave;re
cried exultantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dat de one fo&rsquo; sure!&nbsp; Ah know.&nbsp;
Ah spik true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing to do is to teach these damned Siwashes a little
manners,&rdquo; spoke Webster Shaw.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re getting
fat and sassy, and we&rsquo;ll have to bring them down a peg.&nbsp;
Round in all the bucks and string up the Beaver for an object lesson.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the programme.&nbsp; Come on and let&rsquo;s see what he&rsquo;s
got to say for himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heh, <i>M&rsquo;sieu</i>!&rdquo; Lecl&egrave;re called, as
the crowd began to melt away through the twilight in the direction of
Sunrise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah lak ver&rsquo; moch to see de fon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll turn you loose when we come back,&rdquo; Webster
Shaw shouted over his shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the meantime meditate
on your sins and the ways of Providence.&nbsp; It will do you good,
so be grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As is the way with men who are accustomed to great hazards, whose
nerves are healthy and trained in patience, so it was with Lecl&egrave;re
who settled himself to the long wait&mdash;which is to say that he reconciled
his mind to it.&nbsp; There was no settling of the body, for the taut
rope forced him to stand rigidly erect.&nbsp; The least relaxation of
the leg muscles pressed the rough-fibred noose into his neck, while
the upright position caused him much pain in his wounded shoulder.&nbsp;
He projected his under lip and expelled his breath upwards along his
face to blow the mosquitoes away from his eyes.&nbsp; But the situation
had its compensation.&nbsp; To be snatched from the maw of death was
well worth a little bodily suffering, only it was unfortunate that he
should miss the hanging of the Beaver.</p>
<p>And so he mused, till his eyes chanced to fall upon B&acirc;tard,
head between fore paws and stretched on the ground asleep.&nbsp; And
their Lecl&egrave;re ceased to muse.&nbsp; He studied the animal closely,
striving to sense if the sleep were real or feigned.&nbsp; B&acirc;tard&rsquo;s
sides were heaving regularly, but Lecl&egrave;re felt that the breath
came and went a shade too quickly; also he felt that there was a vigilance
or alertness to every hair that belied unshackling sleep.&nbsp; He would
have given his Sunrise claim to be assured that the dog was not awake,
and once, when one of his joints cracked, he looked quickly and guiltily
at B&acirc;tard to see if he roused.&nbsp; He did not rouse then but
a few minutes later he got up slowly and lazily, stretched, and looked
carefully about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sacredam</i>,&rdquo; said Lecl&egrave;re under his breath.</p>
<p>Assured that no one was in sight or hearing, B&acirc;tard sat down,
curled his upper lip almost into a smile, looked up at Lecl&egrave;re,
and licked his chops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah see my feenish,&rdquo; the man said, and laughed sardonically
aloud.</p>
<p>B&acirc;tard came nearer, the useless ear wabbling, the good ear
cocked forward with devilish comprehension.&nbsp; He thrust his head
on one side quizzically, and advanced with mincing, playful steps.&nbsp;
He rubbed his body gently against the box till it shook and shook again.&nbsp;
Lecl&egrave;re teetered carefully to maintain his equilibrium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;B&acirc;tard,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;look out.&nbsp;
Ah keel you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>B&acirc;tard snarled at the word and shook the box with greater force.&nbsp;
Then he upreared, and with his fore paws threw his weight against it
higher up.&nbsp; Lecl&egrave;re kicked out with one foot, but the rope
bit into his neck and checked so abruptly as nearly to overbalance him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, ya!&nbsp; <i>Chook</i>!&nbsp; <i>Mush</i>-<i>on</i>!&rdquo;
he screamed.</p>
<p>B&acirc;tard retreated, for twenty feet or so, with a fiendish levity
in his bearing that Lecl&egrave;re could not mistake.&nbsp; He remembered
the dog often breaking the scum of ice on the water hole by lifting
up and throwing his weight upon it; and remembering, he understood what
he now had in mind.&nbsp; B&acirc;tard faced about and paused.&nbsp;
He showed his white teeth in a grin, which Lecl&egrave;re answered;
and then hurled his body through the air, in full charge, straight for
the box.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, Slackwater Charley and Webster Shaw returning,
caught a glimpse of a ghostly pendulum swinging back and forth in the
dim light.&nbsp; As they hurriedly drew in closer, they made out the
man&rsquo;s inert body, and a live thing that clung to it, and shook
and worried, and gave to it the swaying motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, ya!&nbsp; <i>Chook</i>! you Spawn of Hell!&rdquo; yelled
Webster Shaw.</p>
<p>But B&acirc;tard glared at him, and snarled threateningly, without
loosing his jaws.</p>
<p>Slackwater Charley got out his revolver, but his hand was shaking,
as with a chill, and he fumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you take it,&rdquo; he said, passing the weapon over.</p>
<p>Webster Shaw laughed shortly, drew a sight between the gleaming eyes,
and pressed the trigger.&nbsp; B&acirc;tard&rsquo;s body twitched with
the shock, threshed the ground spasmodically for a moment, and went
suddenly limp.&nbsp; But his teeth still held fast locked.</p>
<h2>THE STORY OF JEES UCK</h2>
<p>There have been renunciations and renunciations.&nbsp; But, in its
essence, renunciation is ever the same.&nbsp; And the paradox of it
is, that men and women forego the dearest thing in the world for something
dearer.&nbsp; It was never otherwise.&nbsp; Thus it was when Abel brought
of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof.&nbsp; The firstlings
and the fat thereof were to him the dearest things in the world; yet
he gave them over that he might be on good terms with God.&nbsp; So
it was with Abraham when he prepared to offer up his son Isaac on a
stone.&nbsp; Isaac was very dear to him; but God, in incomprehensible
ways, was yet dearer.&nbsp; It may be that Abraham feared the Lord.&nbsp;
But whether that be true or not it has since been determined by a few
billion people that he loved the Lord and desired to serve him.</p>
<p>And since it has been determined that love is service, and since
to renounce is to serve, then Jees Uck, who was merely a woman of a
swart-skinned breed, loved with a great love.&nbsp; She was unversed
in history, having learned to read only the signs of weather and of
game; so she had never heard of Abel nor of Abraham; nor, having escaped
the good sisters at Holy Cross, had she been told the story of Ruth,
the Moabitess, who renounced her very God for the sake of a stranger
woman from a strange land.&nbsp; Jees Uck had learned only one way of
renouncing, and that was with a club as the dynamic factor, in much
the same manner as a dog is made to renounce a stolen marrow-bone.&nbsp;
Yet, when the time came, she proved herself capable of rising to the
height of the fair-faced royal races and of renouncing in right regal
fashion.</p>
<p>So this is the story of Jees Uck, which is also the story of Neil
Bonner, and Kitty Bonner, and a couple of Neil Bonner&rsquo;s progeny.&nbsp;
Jees Uck was of a swart-skinned breed, it is true, but she was not an
Indian; nor was she an Eskimo; nor even an Innuit.&nbsp; Going backward
into mouth tradition, there appears the figure of one Skolkz, a Toyaat
Indian of the Yukon, who journeyed down in his youth to the Great Delta
where dwell the Innuits, and where he foregathered with a woman remembered
as Olillie.&nbsp; Now the woman Olillie had been bred from an Eskimo
mother by an Innuit man.&nbsp; And from Skolkz and Olillie came Halie,
who was one-half Toyaat Indian, one-quarter Innuit, and one-quarter
Eskimo.&nbsp; And Halie was the grandmother of Jees Uck.</p>
<p>Now Halie, in whom three stocks had been bastardized, who cherished
no prejudice against further admixture, mated with a Russian fur trader
called Shpack, also known in his time as the Big Fat.&nbsp; Shpack is
herein classed Russian for lack of a more adequate term; for Shpack&rsquo;s
father, a Slavonic convict from the Lower Provinces, had escaped from
the quicksilver mines into Northern Siberia, where he knew Zimba, who
was a woman of the Deer People and who became the mother of Shpack,
who became the grandfather of Jees Uck.</p>
<p>Now had not Shpack been captured in his boyhood by the Sea People,
who fringe the rim of the Arctic Sea with their misery, he would not
have become the grandfather of Jees Uck and there would be no story
at all.&nbsp; But he <i>was</i> captured by the Sea People, from whom
he escaped to Kamchatka, and thence, on a Norwegian whale-ship, to the
Baltic.&nbsp; Not long after that he turned up in St. Petersburg, and
the years were not many till he went drifting east over the same weary
road his father had measured with blood and groans a half-century before.&nbsp;
But Shpack was a free man, in the employ of the great Russian Fur Company.&nbsp;
And in that employ he fared farther and farther east, until he crossed
Bering Sea into Russian America; and at Pastolik, which is hard by the
Great Delta of the Yukon, became the husband of Halie, who was the grandmother
of Jees Uck.&nbsp; Out of this union came the woman-child, Tukesan.</p>
<p>Shpack, under the orders of the Company, made a canoe voyage of a
few hundred miles up the Yukon to the post of Nulato.&nbsp; With him
he took Halie and the babe Tukesan.&nbsp; This was in 1850, and in 1850
it was that the river Indians fell upon Nulato and wiped it from the
face of the earth.&nbsp; And that was the end of Shpack and Halie.&nbsp;
On that terrible night Tukesan disappeared.&nbsp; To this day the Toyaats
aver they had no hand in the trouble; but, be that as it may, the fact
remains that the babe Tukesan grew up among them.</p>
<p>Tukesan was married successively to two Toyaat brothers, to both
of whom she was barren.&nbsp; Because of this, other women shook their
heads, and no third Toyaat man could be found to dare matrimony with
the childless widow.&nbsp; But at this time, many hundred miles above,
at Fort Yukon, was a man, Spike O&rsquo;Brien.&nbsp; Fort Yukon was
a Hudson Bay Company post, and Spike O&rsquo;Brien one of the Company&rsquo;s
servants.&nbsp; He was a good servant, but he achieved an opinion that
the service was bad, and in the course of time vindicated that opinion
by deserting.&nbsp; It was a year&rsquo;s journey, by the chain of posts,
back to York Factory on Hudson&rsquo;s Bay.&nbsp; Further, being Company
posts, he knew he could not evade the Company&rsquo;s clutches.&nbsp;
Nothing retained but to go down the Yukon.&nbsp; It was true no white
man had ever gone down the Yukon, and no white man knew whether the
Yukon emptied into the Arctic Ocean or Bering Sea; but Spike O&rsquo;Brien
was a Celt, and the promise of danger was a lure he had ever followed.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, somewhat battered, rather famished, and about
dead with river-fever, he drove the nose of his canoe into the earth
bank by the village of the Toyaats and promptly fainted away.&nbsp;
While getting his strength back, in the weeks that followed, he looked
upon Tukesan and found her good.&nbsp; Like the father of Shpack, who
lived to a ripe old age among the Siberian Deer People, Spike O&rsquo;Brien
might have left his aged bones with the Toyaats.&nbsp; But romance gripped
his heart-strings and would not let him stay.&nbsp; As he had journeyed
from York Factory to Fort Yukon, so, first among men, might he journey
from Fort Yukon to the sea and win the honour of being the first man
to make the North-West Passage by land.&nbsp; So he departed down the
river, won the honour, and was unannaled and unsung.&nbsp; In after
years he ran a sailors&rsquo; boarding-house in San Francisco, where
he became esteemed a most remarkable liar by virtue of the gospel truths
he told.&nbsp; But a child was born to Tukesan, who had been childless.&nbsp;
And this child was Jees Uck.&nbsp; Her lineage has been traced at length
to show that she was neither Indian, nor Eskimo, nor Innuit, nor much
of anything else; also to show what waifs of the generations we are,
all of us, and the strange meanderings of the seed from which we spring.</p>
<p>What with the vagrant blood in her and the heritage compounded of
many races, Jees Uck developed a wonderful young beauty.&nbsp; Bizarre,
perhaps, it was, and Oriental enough to puzzle any passing ethnologist.&nbsp;
A lithe and slender grace characterized her.&nbsp; Beyond a quickened
lilt to the imagination, the contribution of the Celt was in no wise
apparent.&nbsp; It might possibly have put the warm blood under her
skin, which made her face less swart and her body fairer; but that,
in turn, might have come from Shpack, the Big Fat, who inherited the
colour of his Slavonic father.&nbsp; And, finally, she had great, blazing
black eyes&mdash;the half-caste eye, round, full-orbed, and sensuous,
which marks the collision of the dark races with the light.&nbsp; Also,
the white blood in her, combined with her knowledge that it was in her,
made her, in a way, ambitious.&nbsp; Otherwise by upbringing and in
outlook on life, she was wholly and utterly a Toyaat Indian.</p>
<p>One winter, when she was a young woman, Neil Bonner came into her
life.&nbsp; But he came into her life, as he had come into the country,
somewhat reluctantly.&nbsp; In fact, it was very much against his will,
coming into the country.&nbsp; Between a father who clipped coupons
and cultivated roses, and a mother who loved the social round, Neil
Bonner had gone rather wild.&nbsp; He was not vicious, but a man with
meat in his belly and without work in the world has to expend his energy
somehow, and Neil Bonner was such a man.&nbsp; And he expended his energy
in such a fashion and to such extent that when the inevitable climax
came, his father, Neil Bonner, senior, crawled out of his roses in a
panic and looked on his son with a wondering eye.&nbsp; Then he hied
himself away to a crony of kindred pursuits, with whom he was wont to
confer over coupons and roses, and between the two the destiny of young
Neil Bonner was made manifest.&nbsp; He must go away, on probation,
to live down his harmless follies in order that he might live up to
their own excellent standard.</p>
<p>This determined upon, and young Neil a little repentant and a great
deal ashamed, the rest was easy.&nbsp; The cronies were heavy stockholders
in the P. C. Company.&nbsp; The P. C. Company owned fleets of river-steamers
and ocean-going craft, and, in addition to farming the sea, exploited
a hundred thousand square miles or so of the land that, on the maps
of geographers, usually occupies the white spaces.&nbsp; So the P. C.
Company sent young Neil Bonner north, where the white spaces are, to
do its work and to learn to be good like his father.&nbsp; &ldquo;Five
years of simplicity, close to the soil and far from temptation, will
make a man of him,&rdquo; said old Neil Bonner, and forthwith crawled
back among his roses.&nbsp; Young Neil set his jaw, pitched his chin
at the proper angle, and went to work.&nbsp; As an underling he did
his work well and gained the commendation of his superiors.&nbsp; Not
that he delighted in the work, but that it was the one thing that prevented
him from going mad.</p>
<p>The first year he wished he was dead.&nbsp; The second year he cursed
God.&nbsp; The third year he was divided between the two emotions, and
in the confusion quarrelled with a man in authority.&nbsp; He had the
best of the quarrel, though the man in authority had the last word,&mdash;a
word that sent Neil Bonner into an exile that made his old billet appear
as paradise.&nbsp; But he went without a whimper, for the North had
succeeded in making him into a man.</p>
<p>Here and there, on the white spaces on the map, little circlets like
the letter &ldquo;o&rdquo; are to be found, and, appended to these circlets,
on one side or the other, are names such as &ldquo;Fort Hamilton,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yanana Station,&rdquo; &ldquo;Twenty Mile,&rdquo; thus leading
one to imagine that the white spaces are plentifully besprinkled with
towns and villages.&nbsp; But it is a vain imagining.&nbsp; Twenty Mile,
which is very like the rest of the posts, is a log building the size
of a corner grocery with rooms to let up-stairs.&nbsp; A long-legged
cache on stilts may be found in the back yard; also a couple of outhouses.&nbsp;
The back yard is unfenced, and extends to the sky-line and an unascertainable
bit beyond.&nbsp; There are no other houses in sight, though the Toyaats
sometimes pitch a winter camp a mile or two down the Yukon.&nbsp; And
this is Twenty Mile, one tentacle of the many-tentacled P. C. Company.&nbsp;
Here the agent, with an assistant, barters with the Indians for their
furs, and does an erratic trade on a gold-dust basis with the wandering
miners.&nbsp; Here, also, the agent and his assistant yearn all winter
for the spring, and when the spring comes, camp blasphemously on the
roof while the Yukon washes out the establishment.&nbsp; And here, also,
in the fourth year of his sojourn in the land, came Neil Bonner to take
charge.</p>
<p>He had displaced no agent; for the man that previously ran the post
had made away with himself; &ldquo;because of the rigours of the place,&rdquo;
said the assistant, who still remained; though the Toyaats, by their
fires, had another version.&nbsp; The assistant was a shrunken-shouldered,
hollow-chested man, with a cadaverous face and cavernous cheeks that
his sparse black beard could not hide.&nbsp; He coughed much, as though
consumption gripped his lungs, while his eyes had that mad, fevered
light common to consumptives in the last stage.&nbsp; Pentley was his
name&mdash;Amos Pentley&mdash;and Bonner did not like him, though he
felt a pity for the forlorn and hopeless devil.&nbsp; They did not get
along together, these two men who, of all men, should have been on good
terms in the face of the cold and silence and darkness of the long winter.</p>
<p>In the end, Bonner concluded that Amos was partly demented, and left
him alone, doing all the work himself except the cooking.&nbsp; Even
then, Amos had nothing but bitter looks and an undisguised hatred for
him.&nbsp; This was a great loss to Bonner; for the smiling face of
one of his own kind, the cheery word, the sympathy of comradeship shared
with misfortune&mdash;these things meant much; and the winter was yet
young when he began to realize the added reasons, with such an assistant,
that the previous agent had found to impel his own hand against his
life.</p>
<p>It was very lonely at Twenty Mile.&nbsp; The bleak vastness stretched
away on every side to the horizon.&nbsp; The snow, which was really
frost, flung its mantle over the land and buried everything in the silence
of death.&nbsp; For days it was clear and cold, the thermometer steadily
recording forty to fifty degrees below zero.&nbsp; Then a change came
over the face of things.&nbsp; What little moisture had oozed into the
atmosphere gathered into dull grey, formless clouds; it became quite
warm, the thermometer rising to twenty below; and the moisture fell
out of the sky in hard frost-granules that hissed like dry sugar or
driving sand when kicked underfoot.&nbsp; After that it became clear
and cold again, until enough moisture had gathered to blanket the earth
from the cold of outer space.&nbsp; That was all.&nbsp; Nothing happened.&nbsp;
No storms, no churning waters and threshing forests, nothing but the
machine-like precipitation of accumulated moisture.&nbsp; Possibly the
most notable thing that occurred through the weary weeks was the gliding
of the temperature up to the unprecedented height of fifteen below.&nbsp;
To atone for this, outer space smote the earth with its cold till the
mercury froze and the spirit thermometer remained more than seventy
below for a fortnight, when it burst.&nbsp; There was no telling how
much colder it was after that.&nbsp; Another occurrence, monotonous
in its regularity, was the lengthening of the nights, till day became
a mere blink of light between the darkness.</p>
<p>Neil Bonner was a social animal.&nbsp; The very follies for which
he was doing penance had been bred of his excessive sociability.&nbsp;
And here, in the fourth year of his exile, he found himself in company&mdash;which
were to travesty the word&mdash;with a morose and speechless creature
in whose sombre eyes smouldered a hatred as bitter as it was unwarranted.&nbsp;
And Bonner, to whom speech and fellowship were as the breath of life,
went about as a ghost might go, tantalized by the gregarious revelries
of some former life.&nbsp; In the day his lips were compressed, his
face stern; but in the night he clenched his hands, rolled about in
his blankets, and cried aloud like a little child.&nbsp; And he would
remember a certain man in authority and curse him through the long hours.&nbsp;
Also, he cursed God.&nbsp; But God understands.&nbsp; He cannot find
it in his heart to blame weak mortals who blaspheme in Alaska.</p>
<p>And here, to the post of Twenty Mile, came Jees Uck, to trade for
flour and bacon, and beads, and bright scarlet cloths for her fancy
work.&nbsp; And further, and unwittingly, she came to the post of Twenty
Mile to make a lonely man more lonely, make him reach out empty arms
in his sleep.&nbsp; For Neil Bonner was only a man.&nbsp; When she first
came into the store, he looked at her long, as a thirsty man may look
at a flowing well.&nbsp; And she, with the heritage bequeathed her by
Spike O&rsquo;Brien, imagined daringly and smiled up into his eyes,
not as the swart-skinned peoples should smile at the royal races, but
as a woman smiles at a man.&nbsp; The thing was inevitable; only, he
did not see it, and fought against her as fiercely and passionately
as he was drawn towards her.&nbsp; And she?&nbsp; She was Jees Uck,
by upbringing wholly and utterly a Toyaat Indian woman.</p>
<p>She came often to the post to trade.&nbsp; And often she sat by the
big wood stove and chatted in broken English with Neil Bonner.&nbsp;
And he came to look for her coming; and on the days she did not come
he was worried and restless.&nbsp; Sometimes he stopped to think, and
then she was met coldly, with a resolve that perplexed and piqued her,
and which, she was convinced, was not sincere.&nbsp; But more often
he did not dare to think, and then all went well and there were smiles
and laughter.&nbsp; And Amos Pentley, gasping like a stranded catfish,
his hollow cough a-reek with the grave, looked upon it all and grinned.&nbsp;
He, who loved life, could not live, and it rankled his soul that others
should be able to live.&nbsp; Wherefore he hated Bonner, who was so
very much alive and into whose eyes sprang joy at the sight of Jees
Uck.&nbsp; As for Amos, the very thought of the girl was sufficient
to send his blood pounding up into a hemorrhage.</p>
<p>Jees Uck, whose mind was simple, who thought elementally and was
unused to weighing life in its subtler quantities, read Amos Pentley
like a book.&nbsp; She warned Bonner, openly and bluntly, in few words;
but the complexities of higher existence confused the situation to him,
and he laughed at her evident anxiety.&nbsp; To him, Amos was a poor,
miserable devil, tottering desperately into the grave.&nbsp; And Bonner,
who had suffered much, found it easy to forgive greatly.</p>
<p>But one morning, during a bitter snap, he got up from the breakfast-table
and went into the store.&nbsp; Jees Uck was already there, rosy from
the trail, to buy a sack of flour.&nbsp; A few minutes later, he was
out in the snow lashing the flour on her sled.&nbsp; As he bent over
he noticed a stiffness in his neck and felt a premonition of impending
physical misfortune.&nbsp; And as he put the last half-hitch into the
lashing and attempted to straighten up, a quick spasm seized him and
he sank into the snow.&nbsp; Tense and quivering, head jerked back,
limbs extended, back arched and mouth twisted and distorted, he appeared
as though being racked limb from limb.&nbsp; Without cry or sound, Jees
Uck was in the snow beside him; but he clutched both her wrists spasmodically,
and as long as the convulsion endured she was helpless.&nbsp; In a few
moments the spasm relaxed and he was left weak and fainting, his forehead
beaded with sweat, and his lips flecked with foam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; he muttered, in a strange, hoarse voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Quick!&nbsp; Inside!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started to crawl on hands and knees, but she raised him up, and,
supported by her young arm, he made faster progress.&nbsp; As he entered
the store the spasm seized him again, and his body writhed irresistibly
away from her and rolled and curled on the floor.&nbsp; Amos Pentley
came and looked on with curious eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Amos!&rdquo; she cried in an agony of apprehension and
helplessness, &ldquo;him die, you think?&rdquo;&nbsp; But Amos shrugged
his shoulders and continued to look on.</p>
<p>Bonner&rsquo;s body went slack, the tense muscles easing down and
an expression of relief coming into his face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo;
he gritted between his teeth, his mouth twisting with the on-coming
of the next spasm and with his effort to control it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Quick,
Jees Uck!&nbsp; The medicine!&nbsp; Never mind!&nbsp; Drag me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knew where the medicine-chest stood, at the rear of the room
beyond the stove, and thither, by the legs, she dragged the struggling
man.&nbsp; As the spasm passed he began, very faint and very sick, to
overhaul the chest.&nbsp; He had seen dogs die exhibiting symptoms similar
to his own, and he knew what should be done.&nbsp; He held up a vial
of chloral hydrate, but his fingers were too weak and nerveless to draw
the cork.&nbsp; This Jees Uck did for him, while he was plunged into
another convulsion.&nbsp; As he came out of it he found the open bottle
proffered him, and looked into the great black eyes of the woman and
read what men have always read in the Mate-woman&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp;
Taking a full dose of the stuff, he sank back until another spasm had
passed.&nbsp; Then he raised himself limply on his elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Jees Uck!&rdquo; he said very slowly, as though aware
of the necessity for haste and yet afraid to hasten.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
what I say.&nbsp; Stay by my side, but do not touch me.&nbsp; I must
be very quiet, but you must not go away.&rdquo;&nbsp; His jaw began
to set and his face to quiver and distort with the fore-running pangs,
but he gulped and struggled to master them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not got
away.&nbsp; And do not let Amos go away.&nbsp; Understand!&nbsp; Amos
must stay right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded her head, and he passed off into the first of many convulsions,
which gradually diminished in force and frequency.&nbsp; Jees Uck hung
over him remembering his injunction and not daring to touch him.&nbsp;
Once Amos grew restless and made as though to go into the kitchen; but
a quick blaze from her eyes quelled him, and after that, save for his
laboured breathing and charnel cough, he was very quiet.</p>
<p>Bonner slept.&nbsp; The blink of light that marked the day disappeared.&nbsp;
Amos, followed about by the woman&rsquo;s eyes, lighted the kerosene
lamps.&nbsp; Evening came on.&nbsp; Through the north window the heavens
were emblazoned with an auroral display, which flamed and flared and
died down into blackness.&nbsp; Some time after that, Neil Bonner roused.&nbsp;
First he looked to see that Amos was still there, then smiled at Jees
Uck and pulled himself up.&nbsp; Every muscle was stiff and sore, and
he smiled ruefully, pressing and prodding himself as if to ascertain
the extent of the ravage.&nbsp; Then his face went stern and businesslike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jees Uck,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take a candle.&nbsp; Go into
the kitchen.&nbsp; There is food on the table&mdash;biscuits and beans
and bacon; also, coffee in the pot on the stove.&nbsp; Bring it here
on the counter.&nbsp; Also, bring tumblers and water and whisky, which
you will find on the top shelf of the locker.&nbsp; Do not forget the
whisky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having swallowed a stiff glass of the whisky, he went carefully through
the medicine chest, now and again putting aside, with definite purpose,
certain bottles and vials.&nbsp; Then he set to work on the food, attempting
a crude analysis.&nbsp; He had not been unused to the laboratory in
his college days and was possessed of sufficient imagination to achieve
results with his limited materials.&nbsp; The condition of tetanus,
which had marked his paroxysms, simplified matters, and he made but
one test.&nbsp; The coffee yielded nothing; nor did the beans.&nbsp;
To the biscuits he devoted the utmost care.&nbsp; Amos, who knew nothing
of chemistry, looked on with steady curiosity.&nbsp; But Jees Uck, who
had boundless faith in the white man&rsquo;s wisdom, and especially
in Neil Bonner&rsquo;s wisdom, and who not only knew nothing but knew
that she knew nothing watched his face rather than his hands.</p>
<p>Step by step he eliminated possibilities, until he came to the final
test.&nbsp; He was using a thin medicine vial for a tube, and this he
held between him and the light, watching the slow precipitation of a
salt through the solution contained in the tube.&nbsp; He said nothing,
but he saw what he had expected to see.&nbsp; And Jees Uck, her eyes
riveted on his face, saw something too,&mdash;something that made her
spring like a tigress upon Amos, and with splendid suppleness and strength
bend his body back across her knee.&nbsp; Her knife was out of its sheaf
and uplifted, glinting in the lamplight.&nbsp; Amos was snarling; but
Bonner intervened ere the blade could fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good girl, Jees Uck.&nbsp; But never mind.&nbsp;
Let him go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dropped the man obediently, though with protest writ large on
her face; and his body thudded to the floor.&nbsp; Bonner nudged him
with his moccasined foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, Amos!&rdquo; he commanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
got to pack an outfit yet to-night and hit the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say&mdash;&rdquo; Amos blurted savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to say that you tried to kill me,&rdquo; Neil went
on in cold, even tones.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean to say that you killed Birdsall,
for all the Company believes he killed himself.&nbsp; You used strychnine
in my case.&nbsp; God knows with what you fixed him.&nbsp; Now I can&rsquo;t
hang you.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re too near dead as it is.&nbsp; But Twenty
Mile is too small for the pair of us, and you&rsquo;ve got to mush.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s two hundred miles to Holy Cross.&nbsp; You can make it if
you&rsquo;re careful not to over-exert.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give you grub,
a sled, and three dogs.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be as safe as if you were
in jail, for you can&rsquo;t get out of the country.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll
give you one chance.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re almost dead.&nbsp; Very well.&nbsp;
I shall send no word to the Company until the spring.&nbsp; In the meantime,
the thing for you to do is to die.&nbsp; Now <i>mush</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go to bed!&rdquo; Jees Uck insisted, when Amos had churned
away into the night towards Holy Cross.&nbsp; &ldquo;You sick man yet,
Neil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re a good girl, Jees Uck,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s my hand on it.&nbsp; But you must go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like me,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
<p>He smiled, helped her on with her <i>parka</i>, and led her to the
door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only too well, Jees Uck,&rdquo; he said softly; &ldquo;only
too well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that the pall of the Arctic night fell deeper and blacker on
the land.&nbsp; Neil Bonner discovered that he had failed to put proper
valuation upon even the sullen face of the murderous and death-stricken
Amos.&nbsp; It became very lonely at Twenty Mile.&nbsp; &ldquo;For the
love of God, Prentiss, send me a man,&rdquo; he wrote to the agent at
Fort Hamilton, three hundred miles up river.&nbsp; Six weeks later the
Indian messenger brought back a reply.&nbsp; It was characteristic:
&ldquo;Hell.&nbsp; Both feet frozen.&nbsp; Need him myself&mdash;Prentiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To make matters worse, most of the Toyaats were in the back country
on the flanks of a caribou herd, and Jees Uck was with them.&nbsp; Removing
to a distance seemed to bring her closer than ever, and Neil Bonner
found himself picturing her, day by day, in camp and on trail.&nbsp;
It is not good to be alone.&nbsp; Often he went out of the quiet store,
bare-headed and frantic, and shook his fist at the blink of day that
came over the southern sky-line.&nbsp; And on still, cold nights he
left his bed and stumbled into the frost, where he assaulted the silence
at the top of his lungs, as though it were some tangible, sentiment
thing that he might arouse; or he shouted at the sleeping dogs till
they howled and howled again.&nbsp; One shaggy brute he brought into
the post, playing that it was the new man sent by Prentiss.&nbsp; He
strove to make it sleep decently under blankets at nights and to sit
at table and eat as a man should; but the beast, mere domesticated wolf
that it was, rebelled, and sought out dark corners and snarled and bit
him in the leg, and was finally beaten and driven forth.</p>
<p>Then the trick of personification seized upon Neil Bonner and mastered
him.&nbsp; All the forces of his environment metamorphosed into living,
breathing entities and came to live with him.&nbsp; He recreated the
primitive pantheon; reared an altar to the sun and burned candle fat
and bacon grease thereon; and in the unfenced yard, by the long-legged
cache, made a frost devil, which he was wont to make faces at and mock
when the mercury oozed down into the bulb.&nbsp; All this in play, of
course.&nbsp; He said it to himself that it was in play, and repeated
it over and over to make sure, unaware that madness is ever prone to
express itself in make-believe and play.</p>
<p>One midwinter day, Father Champreau, a Jesuit missionary, pulled
into Twenty Mile.&nbsp; Bonner fell upon him and dragged him into the
post, and clung to him and wept, until the priest wept with him from
sheer compassion.&nbsp; Then Bonner became madly hilarious and made
lavish entertainment, swearing valiantly that his guest should not depart.&nbsp;
But Father Champreau was pressing to Salt Water on urgent business for
his order, and pulled out next morning, with Bonner&rsquo;s blood threatened
on his head.</p>
<p>And the threat was in a fair way toward realization, when the Toyaats
returned from their long hunt to the winter camp.&nbsp; They had many
furs, and there was much trading and stir at Twenty Mile.&nbsp; Also,
Jees Uck came to buy beads and scarlet cloths and things, and Bonner
began to find himself again.&nbsp; He fought for a week against her.&nbsp;
Then the end came one night when she rose to leave.&nbsp; She had not
forgotten her repulse, and the pride that drove Spike O&rsquo;Brien
on to complete the North-West Passage by land was her pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go now,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;good-night, Neil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he came up behind her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, it is not well,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>And as she turned her face toward his with a sudden joyful flash,
he bent forward, slowly and gravely, as it were a sacred thing, and
kissed her on the lips.&nbsp; The Toyaats had never taught her the meaning
of a kiss upon the lips, but she understood and was glad.</p>
<p>With the coming of Jees Uck, at once things brightened up.&nbsp;
She was regal in her happiness, a source of unending delight.&nbsp;
The elemental workings of her mind and her naive little ways made an
immense sum of pleasurable surprise to the over-civilized man that had
stooped to catch her up.&nbsp; Not alone was she solace to his loneliness,
but her primitiveness rejuvenated his jaded mind.&nbsp; It was as though,
after long wandering, he had returned to pillow his head in the lap
of Mother Earth.&nbsp; In short, in Jees Uck he found the youth of the
world&mdash;the youth and the strength and the joy.</p>
<p>And to fill the full round of his need, and that they might not see
overmuch of each other, there arrived at Twenty Mile one Sandy MacPherson,
as companionable a man as ever whistled along the trail or raised a
ballad by a camp-fire.&nbsp; A Jesuit priest had run into his camp,
a couple of hundred miles up the Yukon, in the nick of time to say a
last word over the body of Sandy&rsquo;s partner.&nbsp; And on departing,
the priest had said, &ldquo;My son, you will be lonely now.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And Sandy had bowed his head brokenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;At Twenty Mile,&rdquo;
the priest added, &ldquo;there is a lonely man.&nbsp; You have need
of each other, my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was that Sandy became a welcome third at the post, brother
to the man and woman that resided there.&nbsp; He took Bonner moose-hunting
and wolf-trapping; and, in return, Bonner resurrected a battered and
way-worn volume and made him friends with Shakespeare, till Sandy declaimed
iambic pentameters to his sled-dogs whenever they waxed mutinous.&nbsp;
And of the long evenings they played cribbage and talked and disagreed
about the universe, the while Jees Uck rocked matronly in an easy-chair
and darned their moccasins and socks.</p>
<p>Spring came.&nbsp; The sun shot up out of the south.&nbsp; The land
exchanged its austere robes for the garb of a smiling wanton.&nbsp;
Everywhere light laughed and life invited.&nbsp; The days stretched
out their balmy length and the nights passed from blinks of darkness
to no darkness at all.&nbsp; The river bared its bosom, and snorting
steamboats challenged the wilderness.&nbsp; There were stir and bustle,
new faces, and fresh facts.&nbsp; An assistant arrived at Twenty Mile,
and Sandy MacPherson wandered off with a bunch of prospectors to invade
the Koyokuk country.&nbsp; And there were newspapers and magazines and
letters for Neil Bonner.&nbsp; And Jees Uck looked on in worriment,
for she knew his kindred talked with him across the world.</p>
<p>Without much shock, it came to him that his father was dead.&nbsp;
There was a sweet letter of forgiveness, dictated in his last hours.&nbsp;
There were official letters from the Company, graciously ordering him
to turn the post over to the assistant and permitting him to depart
at his earliest pleasure.&nbsp; A long, legal affair from the lawyers
informed him of interminable lists of stocks and bonds, real estate,
rents, and chattels that were his by his father&rsquo;s will.&nbsp;
And a dainty bit of stationery, sealed and monogramed, implored dear
Neil&rsquo;s return to his heart-broken and loving mother.</p>
<p>Neil Bonner did some swift thinking, and when the <i>Yukon</i> <i>Belle</i>
coughed in to the bank on her way down to Bering Sea, he departed&mdash;departed
with the ancient lie of quick return young and blithe on his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back, dear Jees Uck, before the first snow
flies,&rdquo; he promised her, between the last kisses at the gang-plank.</p>
<p>And not only did he promise, but, like the majority of men under
the same circumstances, he really meant it.&nbsp; To John Thompson,
the new agent, he gave orders for the extension of unlimited credit
to his wife, Jees Uck.&nbsp; Also, with his last look from the deck
of the <i>Yukon</i> <i>Belle</i>, he saw a dozen men at work rearing
the logs that were to make the most comfortable house along a thousand
miles of river front&mdash;the house of Jees Uck, and likewise the house
of Neil Bonner&mdash;ere the first flurry of snow.&nbsp; For he fully
and fondly meant to come back.&nbsp; Jees Uck was dear to him, and,
further, a golden future awaited the north.&nbsp; With his father&rsquo;s
money he intended to verify that future.&nbsp; An ambitious dream allured
him.&nbsp; With his four years of experience, and aided by the friendly
co&ouml;peration of the P. C. Company, he would return to become the
Rhodes of Alaska.&nbsp; And he would return, fast as steam could drive,
as soon as he had put into shape the affairs of his father, whom he
had never known, and comforted his mother, whom he had forgotten.</p>
<p>There was much ado when Neil Bonner came back from the Arctic.&nbsp;
The fires were lighted and the fleshpots slung, and he took of it all
and called it good.&nbsp; Not only was he bronzed and creased, but he
was a new man under his skin, with a grip on things and a seriousness
and control.&nbsp; His old companions were amazed when he declined to
hit up the pace in the good old way, while his father&rsquo;s crony
rubbed hands gleefully, and became an authority upon the reclamation
of wayward and idle youth.</p>
<p>For four years Neil Bonner&rsquo;s mind had lain fallow.&nbsp; Little
that was new had been added to it, but it had undergone a process of
selection.&nbsp; It had, so to say, been purged of the trivial and superfluous.&nbsp;
He had lived quick years, down in the world; and, up in the wilds, time
had been given him to organize the confused mass of his experiences.&nbsp;
His superficial standards had been flung to the winds and new standards
erected on deeper and broader generalizations.&nbsp; Concerning civilization,
he had gone away with one set of values, had returned with another set
of values.&nbsp; Aided, also, by the earth smells in his nostrils and
the earth sights in his eyes, he laid hold of the inner significance
of civilization, beholding with clear vision its futilities and powers.&nbsp;
It was a simple little philosophy he evolved.&nbsp; Clean living was
the way to grace.&nbsp; Duty performed was sanctification.&nbsp; One
must live clean and do his duty in order that he might work.&nbsp; Work
was salvation.&nbsp; And to work toward life abundant, and more abundant,
was to be in line with the scheme of things and the will of God.</p>
<p>Primarily, he was of the city.&nbsp; And his fresh earth grip and
virile conception of humanity gave him a finer sense of civilization
and endeared civilization to him.&nbsp; Day by day the people of the
city clung closer to him and the world loomed more colossal.&nbsp; And,
day by day, Alaska grew more remote and less real.&nbsp; And then he
met Kitty Sharon&mdash;a woman of his own flesh and blood and kind;
a woman who put her hand into his hand and drew him to her, till he
forgot the day and hour and the time of the year the first snow flies
on the Yukon.</p>
<p>Jees Uck moved into her grand log-house and dreamed away three golden
summer months.&nbsp; Then came the autumn, post-haste before the down
rush of winter.&nbsp; The air grew thin and sharp, the days thin and
short.&nbsp; The river ran sluggishly, and skin ice formed in the quiet
eddies.&nbsp; All migratory life departed south, and silence fell upon
the land.&nbsp; The first snow flurries came, and the last homing steamboat
bucked desperately into the running mush ice.&nbsp; Then came the hard
ice, solid cakes and sheets, till the Yukon ran level with its banks.&nbsp;
And when all this ceased the river stood still and the blinking days
lost themselves in the darkness.</p>
<p>John Thompson, the new agent, laughed; but Jees Uck had faith in
the mischances of sea and river.&nbsp; Neil Bonner might be frozen in
anywhere between Chilkoot Pass and St. Michael&rsquo;s, for the last
travellers of the year are always caught by the ice, when they exchange
boat for sled and dash on through the long hours behind the flying dogs.</p>
<p>But no flying dogs came up the trail, nor down the trail, to Twenty
Mile.&nbsp; And John Thompson told Jees Uck, with a certain gladness
ill concealed, that Bonner would never come back again.&nbsp; Also,
and brutally, he suggested his own eligibility.&nbsp; Jees Uck laughed
in his face and went back to her grand log-house.&nbsp; But when midwinter
came, when hope dies down and life is at its lowest ebb, Jees Uck found
she had no credit at the store.&nbsp; This was Thompson&rsquo;s doing,
and he rubbed his hands, and walked up and down, and came to his door
and looked up at Jees Uck&rsquo;s house and waited.&nbsp; And he continued
to wait.&nbsp; She sold her dog-team to a party of miners and paid cash
for her food.&nbsp; And when Thompson refused to honour even her coin,
Toyaat Indians made her purchases, and sledded them up to her house
in the dark.</p>
<p>In February the first post came in over the ice, and John Thompson
read in the society column of a five-months-old paper of the marriage
of Neil Bonner and Kitty Sharon.&nbsp; Jees Uck held the door ajar and
him outside while he imparted the information; and, when he had done,
laughed pridefully and did not believe.&nbsp; In March, and all alone,
she gave birth to a man-child, a brave bit of new life at which she
marvelled.&nbsp; And at that hour, a year later, Neil Bonner sat by
another bed, marvelling at another bit of new life that had fared into
the world.</p>
<p>The snow went off the ground and the ice broke out of the Yukon.&nbsp;
The sun journeyed north, and journeyed south again; and, the money from
the being spent, Jees Uck went back to her own people.&nbsp; Oche Ish,
a shrewd hunter, proposed to kill the meat for her and her babe, and
catch the salmon, if she would marry him.&nbsp; And Imego and Hah Yo
and Wy Nooch, husky young hunters all, made similar proposals.&nbsp;
But she elected to live alone and seek her own meat and fish.&nbsp;
She sewed moccasins and <i>parkas</i> and mittens&mdash;warm, serviceable
things, and pleasing to the eye, withal, what of the ornamental hair-tufts
and bead-work.&nbsp; These she sold to the miners, who were drifting
faster into the land each year.&nbsp; And not only did she win food
that was good and plentiful, but she laid money by, and one day took
passage on the <i>Yukon</i> <i>Belle</i> down the river.</p>
<p>At St. Michael&rsquo;s she washed dishes in the kitchen of the post.&nbsp;
The servants of the Company wondered at the remarkable woman with the
remarkable child, though they asked no questions and she vouchsafed
nothing.&nbsp; But just before Bering Sea closed in for the year, she
bought a passage south on a strayed sealing schooner.&nbsp; That winter
she cooked for Captain Markheim&rsquo;s household at Unalaska, and in
the spring continued south to Sitka on a whisky sloop.&nbsp; Later on
appeared at Metlakahtla, which is near to St. Mary&rsquo;s on the end
of the Pan-Handle, where she worked in the cannery through the salmon
season.&nbsp; When autumn came and the Siwash fishermen prepared to
return to Puget Sound, she embarked with a couple of families in a big
cedar canoe; and with them she threaded the hazardous chaos of the Alaskan
and Canadian coasts, till the Straits of Juan de Fuca were passed and
she led her boy by the hand up the hard pave of Seattle.</p>
<p>There she met Sandy MacPherson, on a windy corner, very much surprised
and, when he had heard her story, very wroth&mdash;not so wroth as he
might have been, had he known of Kitty Sharon; but of her Jees Uck breathed
not a word, for she had never believed.&nbsp; Sandy, who read commonplace
and sordid desertion into the circumstance, strove to dissuade her from
her trip to San Francisco, where Neil Bonner was supposed to live when
he was at home.&nbsp; And, having striven, he made her comfortable,
bought her tickets and saw her off, the while smiling in her face and
muttering &ldquo;dam-shame&rdquo; into his beard.</p>
<p>With roar and rumble, through daylight and dark, swaying and lurching
between the dawns, soaring into the winter snows and sinking to summer
valleys, skirting depths, leaping chasms, piercing mountains, Jees Uck
and her boy were hurled south.&nbsp; But she had no fear of the iron
stallion; nor was she stunned by this masterful civilization of Neil
Bonner&rsquo;s people.&nbsp; It seemed, rather, that she saw with greater
clearness the wonder that a man of such godlike race had held her in
his arms.&nbsp; The screaming medley of San Francisco, with its restless
shipping, belching factories, and thundering traffic, did not confuse
her; instead, she comprehended swiftly the pitiful sordidness of Twenty
Mile and the skin-lodged Toyaat village.&nbsp; And she looked down at
the boy that clutched her hand and wondered that she had borne him by
such a man.</p>
<p>She paid the hack-driver five pieces and went up the stone steps
of Neil Bonner&rsquo;s front door.&nbsp; A slant-eyed Japanese parleyed
with her for a fruitless space, then led her inside and disappeared.&nbsp;
She remained in the hall, which to her simply fancy seemed to be the
guest-room&mdash;the show-place wherein were arrayed all the household
treasures with the frank purpose of parade and dazzlement.&nbsp; The
walls and ceiling were of oiled and panelled redwood.&nbsp; The floor
was more glassy than glare-ice, and she sought standing place on one
of the great skins that gave a sense of security to the polished surface.&nbsp;
A huge fireplace&mdash;an extravagant fireplace, she deemed it&mdash;yawned
in the farther wall.&nbsp; A flood of light, mellowed by stained glass,
fell across the room, and from the far end came the white gleam of a
marble figure.</p>
<p>This much she saw, and more, when the slant-eyed servant led the
way past another room&mdash;of which she caught a fleeting glance&mdash;and
into a third, both of which dimmed the brave show of the entrance hall.&nbsp;
And to her eyes the great house seemed to hold out the promise of endless
similar rooms.&nbsp; There was such length and breadth to them, and
the ceilings were so far away!&nbsp; For the first time since her advent
into the white man&rsquo;s civilization, a feeling of awe laid hold
of her.&nbsp; Neil, her Neil, lived in this house, breathed the air
of it, and lay down at night and slept!&nbsp; It was beautiful, all
this that she saw, and it pleased her; but she felt, also, the wisdom
and mastery behind.&nbsp; It was the concrete expression of power in
terms of beauty, and it was the power that she unerringly divined.</p>
<p>And then came a woman, queenly tall, crowned with a glory of hair
that was like a golden sun.&nbsp; She seemed to come toward Jees Uck
as a ripple of music across still water; her sweeping garment itself
a song, her body playing rhythmically beneath.&nbsp; Jees Uck herself
was a man compeller.&nbsp; There were Oche Ish and Imego and Hah Yo
and Wy Nooch, to say nothing of Neil Bonner and John Thompson and other
white men that had looked upon her and felt her power.&nbsp; But she
gazed upon the wide blue eyes and rose-white skin of this woman that
advanced to meet her, and she measured her with woman&rsquo;s eyes looking
through man&rsquo;s eyes; and as a man compeller she felt herself diminish
and grow insignificant before this radiant and flashing creature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wish to see my husband?&rdquo; the woman asked; and Jees
Uck gasped at the liquid silver of a voice that had never sounded harsh
cries at snarling wolf-dogs, nor moulded itself to a guttural speech,
nor toughened in storm and frost and camp smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Jees Uck answered slowly and gropingly, in order
that she might do justice to her English.&nbsp; &ldquo;I come to see
Neil Bonner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is my husband,&rdquo; the woman laughed.</p>
<p>Then it was true!&nbsp; John Thompson had not lied that bleak February
day, when she laughed pridefully and shut the door in his face.&nbsp;
As once she had thrown Amos Pentley across her knee and ripped her knife
into the air, so now she felt impelled to spring upon this woman and
bear her back and down, and tear the life out of her fair body.&nbsp;
But Jees Uck was thinking quickly and gave no sign, and Kitty Bonner
little dreamed how intimately she had for an instant been related with
sudden death.</p>
<p>Jees Uck nodded her head that she understood, and Kitty Bonner explained
that Neil was expected at any moment.&nbsp; Then they sat down on ridiculously
comfortable chairs, and Kitty sought to entertain her strange visitor,
and Jees Uck strove to help her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew my husband in the North?&rdquo; Kitty asked, once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&nbsp; I wash um clothes,&rdquo; Jees Uck had answered,
her English abruptly beginning to grow atrocious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is your boy?&nbsp; I have a little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty caused her daughter to be brought, and while the children,
after their manner, struck an acquaintance, the mothers indulged in
the talk of mothers and drank tea from cups so fragile that Jees Uck
feared lest hers should crumble to pieces beneath her fingers.&nbsp;
Never had she seen such cups, so delicate and dainty.&nbsp; In her mind
she compared them with the woman who poured the tea, and there uprose
in contrast the gourds and pannikins of the Toyaat village and the clumsy
mugs of Twenty Mile, to which she likened herself.&nbsp; And in such
fashion and such terms the problem presented itself.&nbsp; She was beaten.&nbsp;
There was a woman other than herself better fitted to bear and upbring
Neil Bonner&rsquo;s children.&nbsp; Just as his people exceeded her
people, so did his womankind exceed her.&nbsp; They were the man compellers,
as their men were the world compellers.&nbsp; She looked at the rose-white
tenderness of Kitty Bonner&rsquo;s skin and remembered the sun-beat
on her own face.&nbsp; Likewise she looked from brown hand to white&mdash;the
one, work-worn and hardened by whip-handle and paddle, the other as
guiltless of toil and soft as a newborn babe&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And, for
all the obvious softness and apparent weakness, Jees Uck looked into
the blue eyes and saw the mastery she had seen in Neil Bonner&rsquo;s
eyes and in the eyes of Neil Bonner&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Jees Uck!&rdquo; Neil Bonner said, when he
entered.&nbsp; He said it calmly, with even a ring of joyful cordiality,
coming over to her and shaking both her hands, but looking into her
eyes with a worry in his own that she understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Neil!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You look much good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine, fine, Jees Uck,&rdquo; he answered heartily, though
secretly studying Kitty for some sign of what had passed between the
two.&nbsp; Yet he knew his wife too well to expect, even though the
worst had passed, such a sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t say how glad I am to see you,&rdquo; he
went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&nbsp; Did you strike a
mine?&nbsp; And when did you get in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo-a, I get in to-day,&rdquo; she replied, her voice instinctively
seeking its guttural parts.&nbsp; &ldquo;I no strike it, Neil.&nbsp;
You known Cap&rsquo;n Markheim, Unalaska?&nbsp; I cook, his house, long
time.&nbsp; No spend money.&nbsp; Bime-by, plenty.&nbsp; Pretty good,
I think, go down and see White Man&rsquo;s Land.&nbsp; Very fine, White
Man&rsquo;s Land, very fine,&rdquo; she added.&nbsp; Her English puzzled
him, for Sandy and he had sought, constantly, to better her speech,
and she had proved an apt pupil.&nbsp; Now it seemed that she had sunk
back into her race.&nbsp; Her face was guileless, stolidly guileless,
giving no cue.&nbsp; Kitty&rsquo;s untroubled brow likewise baffled
him.&nbsp; What had happened?&nbsp; How much had been said? and how
much guessed?</p>
<p>While he wrestled with these questions and while Jees Uck wrestled
with her problem&mdash;never had he looked so wonderful and great&mdash;a
silence fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think that you knew my husband in Alaska!&rdquo; Kitty
said softly.</p>
<p>Knew him!&nbsp; Jees Uck could not forbear a glance at the boy she
had borne him, and his eyes followed hers mechanically to the window
where played the two children.&nbsp; An iron hand seemed to tighten
across his forehead.&nbsp; His knees went weak and his heart leaped
up and pounded like a fist against his breast.&nbsp; His boy!&nbsp;
He had never dreamed it!</p>
<p>Little Kitty Bonner, fairylike in gauzy lawn, with pinkest of cheeks
and bluest of dancing eyes, arms outstretched and lips puckered in invitation,
was striving to kiss the boy.&nbsp; And the boy, lean and lithe, sunbeaten
and browned, skin-clad and in hair-fringed and hair-tufted <i>muclucs</i>
that showed the wear of the sea and rough work, coolly withstood her
advances, his body straight and stiff with the peculiar erectness common
to children of savage people.&nbsp; A stranger in a strange land, unabashed
and unafraid, he appeared more like an untamed animal, silent and watchful,
his black eyes flashing from face to face, quiet so long as quiet endured,
but prepared to spring and fight and tear and scratch for life, at the
first sign of danger.</p>
<p>The contrast between boy and girl was striking, but not pitiful.&nbsp;
There was too much strength in the boy for that, waif that he was of
the generations of Shpack, Spike O&rsquo;Brien, and Bonner.&nbsp; In
his features, clean cut as a cameo and almost classic in their severity,
there were the power and achievement of his father, and his grandfather,
and the one known as the Big Fat, who was captured by the Sea people
and escaped to Kamchatka.</p>
<p>Neil Bonner fought his emotion down, swallowed it down, and choked
over it, though his face smiled with good-humour and the joy with which
one meets a friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your boy, eh, Jees Uck?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; And then turning
to Kitty: &ldquo;Handsome fellow!&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll do something with
those two hands of his in this our world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty nodded concurrence.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>The young savage flashed his quick eyes upon her and dwelt over her
for a space, seeking out, as it were, the motive beneath the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neil,&rdquo; he answered deliberately when the scrutiny had
satisfied him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Injun talk,&rdquo; Jees Uck interposed, glibly manufacturing
languages on the spur of the moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Him Injun talk, <i>nee</i>-<i>al</i>
all the same &lsquo;cracker.&rsquo;&nbsp; Him baby, him like cracker;
him cry for cracker.&nbsp; Him say, &lsquo;<i>Nee</i>-<i>al</i>, <i>nee</i>-<i>al</i>,&rsquo;
all time him say, &lsquo;<i>Nee</i>-<i>al</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then I say
that um name.&nbsp; So um name all time Nee-al.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never did sound more blessed fall upon Neil Bonner&rsquo;s ear than
that lie from Jees Uck&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp; It was the cue, and he knew
there was reason for Kitty&rsquo;s untroubled brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his father?&rdquo; Kitty asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;He must be
a fine man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo-a, yes,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Um father fine
man.&nbsp; Sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know him, Neil?&rdquo; queried Kitty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know him?&nbsp; Most intimately,&rdquo; Neil answered, and
harked back to dreary Twenty Mile and the man alone in the silence with
his thoughts.</p>
<p>And here might well end the story of Jees Uck but for the crown she
put upon her renunciation.&nbsp; When she returned to the North to dwell
in her grand log-house, John Thompson found that the P. C. Company could
make a shift somehow to carry on its business without his aid.&nbsp;
Also, the new agent and the succeeding agents received instructions
that the woman Jees Uck should be given whatsoever goods and grub she
desired, in whatsoever quantities she ordered, and that no charge should
be placed upon the books.&nbsp; Further, the Company paid yearly to
the woman Jees Uck a pension of five thousand dollars.</p>
<p>When he had attained suitable age, Father Champreau laid hands upon
the boy, and the time was not long when Jees Uck received letters regularly
from the Jesuit college in Maryland.&nbsp; Later on these letters came
from Italy, and still later from France.&nbsp; And in the end there
returned to Alaska one Father Neil, a man mighty for good in the land,
who loved his mother and who ultimately went into a wider field and
rose to high authority in the order.</p>
<p>Jees Uck was a young woman when she went back into the North, and
men still looked upon her and yearned.&nbsp; But she lived straight,
and no breath was ever raised save in commendation.&nbsp; She stayed
for a while with the good sisters at Holy Cross, where she learned to
read and write and became versed in practical medicine and surgery.&nbsp;
After that she returned to her grand log-house and gathered about her
the young girls of the Toyaat village, to show them the way of their
feet in the world.&nbsp; It is neither Protestant nor Catholic, this
school in the house built by Neil Bonner for Jees Uck, his wife; but
the missionaries of all the sects look upon it with equal favour.&nbsp;
The latchstring is always out, and tired prospectors and trail-weary
men turn aside from the flowing river or frozen trail to rest there
for a space and be warm by her fire.&nbsp; And, down in the States,
Kitty Bonner is pleased at the interest her husband takes in Alaskan
education and the large sums he devotes to that purpose; and, though
she often smiles and chaffs, deep down and secretly she is but the prouder
of him.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
